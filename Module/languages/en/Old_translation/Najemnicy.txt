Greetings my Lord, are you looking for men willing to work or maybe someone to protect you and you're goods?  Me and my companions, are looking for honest work, bunch of large chaps we could be quite useful for you m'lord, especially that roads these days roads are very unsafe for men like yourself, for a decent pay we're ready to join you in your travels.

- How much do you want for your services?
- And whom is a threat to me that I should employ you and your men?
-  Be out of my way, at once.

Well we shall need few coins for lead for the bullets, and enough denars left for women and booze before we leave, 450 it will be then, not less, such amount for you m'lord is surely nothing.
M'lord shouldn't worry about that, either give us work or be out of our way, So what's it gonna be?

- How much do you want?
- I do not employ men like you, farewell. 

- Eh, you're not cheap , but surely you will be useful to me, here the money.

-  400 zloties and not a penny less.
- For this amount I could spend the rest of my life in a tavern getting drunk, farewell.

Generous you are indeed my m'lord, after the breakfast we shall be fully prepared for our travels. 

Eh, without the booze we will surely make in time, its a deal. 

Lub – Whores and booze is a must, you cannot truly taste one without the other. 
 As you wish m'lord, be at guard and ensure to watch your back.
