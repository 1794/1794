dlga_zniewaga_start1:zniewaga_start2|The man in question, is an old rival of mine, "who paid suit to the same lady I did. Of course, ", the lady chose me. The villain couldn't stomach the rejection and he visits his rage and frustrations, to this very day!

dlga_kochanka_pozyczka:kochanka_pozyczka2|I gave you money, no further than a couple days ago, I don't have any anymore.

dlga_qsyn_finish:qsyn_finish4|I've talked to your son, he's young, but he has a great spirit and the ability to serve the homeland greatly. Give him your blessing and pray for him and the Commonwealth.
dlga_qsyn_finish:qsyn_finish3|I'm sorry, but I did not manage to persuade him out of his plans.
dlga_qsyn_finish:qsyn_finish2|I've manage to persuade you son, at least so as to, consider staying home...
dlga_qsyn_finish:qsyn_finish1|I've succeeded, the son will remain home.
dlga_qsyn_finish4:close_window|{s20}, 
dlga_qsyn_finish3:close_window|Oh, damn you, I knew it would end like that... that rascal is a real pain. Farewell.
dlga_qsyn_finish2:close_window|This will do, here's the half of the money. That's how much you earned.
dlga_qsyn_finish1:close_window|Truly?! How have you done it? Ah, nevermind. I wholeheartedly thank you! Take this purse, five hundred, no less. May they serve you well.

dlga_qsyn_talk3:qsyn_talk_convince|All my friends are joining the volunteer companies, infantry and cavalry, one even joined the artillery... and me? I'm supposed to stay at home with old ladies?
dlga_qsyn_talk_convince:qsyn_talk_convince_1|You are right, but so are your father's worries.
dlga_qsyn_talk_convince_1:qsyn_talk_convince_1_1|Your father's worries are justified - what will he do if you don't return, "or return a cripple? They need you, boy. It will be hard for them to survive in the uncertain times..."
dlga_qsyn_talk_convince_1_1:qsyn_end|Well, you have a point... tell my father that I will stay, at least until summer, maybe longer.
dlga_qsyn_talk_convince_1_1:qsyn_end.1|Hmm... you have a point. But I cannot resign now, I've signed everything already. Tell father, however, that I'll think of it. I'm not saying I will stay, but I have to think about it. Now go.
dlga_qsyn_talk_convince_1_1:qsyn_end.2|Really? I'm sorry, but I cannot resign now...
dlga_qsyn_talk_convince:qsyn_talk_convince_2|I've seen war many times.
dlga_qsyn_talk_convince_2:qsyn_talk_tell|I've seen war many times, barely made it alive from many a battle, often victorious, but I know how many people lost their lives. So don't be surprised that your father wants to keep you by his side. Death on the battlefield comes easily, believe me, especially since I'm a man experienced in these matters. You've likely heard of me many times...
dlga_qsyn_talk_tell:qsyn_end_2|Indeed, I've heard many times of your victories, as a matter of fact...
dlga_qsyn_talk_tell:close_window|Eh? Who are you that I should have heard about? Please.
dlga_qsyn_talk_convince:qsyn_talk_convince_3|You are in the right.
dlga_qsyn_talk_convince_3:close_window|Finally, a reasonable man! Now go back to my father and tell him that.
dlga_qsyn_end:qsyn_endd|Well, if you said so, I'll be off then.
dlga_qsyn_end:qsyn_endd.1|So be it, I rest my case, however consider it well in your conscience.
dlga_qsyn_end:qsyn_endd.2|I knew you are a reasonable man. Believe me, it's better that way.
dlga_qsyn_endd:close_window|Right, and tell him not to sent anyone anymore... I'm tired of their persuasions, bribery and misguided argumentations.
dlga_qsyn_endd:close_window.1|I will certainly do so - and relay that to my father.
dlga_qsyn_endd:close_window.2|Better not, especially for the Fatherland... but as you said, "I must stay and defend the family. Relay the news to my father, please.", 
dlga_qsyn_end_2:close_window|The tales don't measure up to reality, I see.
dlga_qsyn_end_2:close_window.1|Tell them, I will consider staying home, but that's all I can promise.
dlga_qsyn_end_2:close_window.2|Tell my father that, for now, I will stay, and we'll see what future brings later.

dlga_start:close_window.11|Eh, you again? Don't bore me.
dlga_start:close_window.12|Leave, would you kindly?
dlga_uciekinier_1:uciekinier_ask_karczmarz|I am looking for a certain Ensign Swistacki, would you happen to have welcomed such a person here? He's a man of large frame, built like brick shithouse. I wanted to have a drink with an old companion, and I cannot find him now...
dlga_uciekinier_ask_karczmarz:uciekinier_ask_karczmarz2|Ensign Swistacki? Hmm, I've heard something, but for the life of me I cannot remember now... you see, I just cook food and wash the tankards every Saint Vitus, what could I have seen here?
dlga_uciekinier_ask_karczmarz2:uciekinier_ask|Perhaps this will refresh your memories. (5 zloty), 
dlga_uciekinier_ask_karczmarz2:close_window|I will come back later then.
dlga_uciekinier_ask:uciekinier_info|Hmm... indeed, I think I'm starting to remember!
dlga_uciekinier_info:uciekinier_info_bye|I've seen such a man, he was travelling along the road to {s21}. Pretty recently, when I was opening the tavern, if you set out now, you will catch up with him.
dlga_uciekinier_info:uciekinier_info_bye.1|I've seen such a man, he was here {reg21} days ago and departed towards {s21}. I don't know anymore about him, or his destination for that matter.
dlga_uciekinier_info:uciekinier_info_bye.2|No, that was not the man. He was short and thin and didn't seem like an ensign at all, more like a deserter, and we have more than enough of these lowlifes. So no, your friend was not here. Anything I should tell him if he shows up?
dlga_uciekinier_info_bye:close_window|That's my companion! I'll catch up with him on the road, farewell.
dlga_uciekinier_info_bye:close_window.1|Then I shall continue to look for him, farewell.
dlga_uciekinier_info_bye:close_window.2|No, and certainly don't mention, that I've been looking for him. I want it to be a surprise.
dlga_start:uciekinier_karczma_1|They serve excellent drinks in this here establishment, would you like to have one?

dlga_uciekinier_karczma_poznaj3:uciekinier_karczma_poznaj4|General Kosciuszko, I'm supposed to deliver the message in person.
dlga_uciekinier_karczma_poznaj4:uciekinier_karczma_poznaj5|You are lying.
dlga_uciekinier_karczma_poznaj5:uciekinier_karczma_poznaj6|Lies! As it happens the Chief has been away from Krakow for the last month. Would you please explain that?
dlga_uciekinier_karczma_poznaj6:uciekinier_karczma_pojedynek|You're calling me a liar?! You'll pay for that. ^ Stand and deliver, we'll fight with rapiers!

dlga_uciekinier_karczma_poznaj2:close_window|Let's have a drink, before we hit the road.
dlga_uciekinier_karczma_1:uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj|Before I take the manacles out, speak, who are you?
dlga_uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj:uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj2|Are you feeble-minded? Should I call a barber?
dlga_uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj2:uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj3|That's no way to talk to an officer.
dlga_uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj3:uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj4|Be quiet! And speak! Who are you, and where from, or else.
dlga_uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj4:uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj5|I've been dabbling in sciences, astronomy, physics, didn't mind medicine either... if you need bloodletting, just say the word.
dlga_uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj5:uciekinier_karczma_przyznaj6|You won't get away with this! Stand and deliver.

dlga_uciekinier_catch1:uciekinier_catch2|Be you Ensign Swistacki?
dlga_uciekinier_catch2:uciekinier_catch3|Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. What's your business?
dlga_uciekinier_catch3:uciekinier_catch4|{s69} {playername}, I come with an order from the Chief.
dlga_uciekinier_catch4:uciekinier_catch5|You are under arrest for desertion. You will go with me to Chief Kosciuszko now.
dlga_uciekinier_catch5:uciekinier_catch6|You dare speak to me like that?! A hero of the battle in Raclawice?! How dare you!
dlga_uciekinier_catch6:close_window|Now just a deserter. We're off.
dlga_start:uciekinier_first1|Greetings, look just who it is! I didn't expect to see you here. Glad to see you, old friend. I see, you've gotten a rank and a nice regiment, congratulations.
dlga_uciekinier_first1:uciekinier_first2|Hello. Seems like you're an officer too. It's an honor.
dlga_uciekinier_first2:uciekinier_first3|nie ma tego, 
dlga_uciekinier_first2:uciekinier_first_tukaj|Right, I've been lucky as well... ^Warm day today, my throat feels dry. What would you say we go to the nearby tavern for a drink or two? I heard, they have excellent beer there, just right for a chat.
dlga_uciekinier_first_tukaj:uciekinier_a1|Now's not the right moment, we need to talk.
dlga_uciekinier_a1:uciekinier_b1|You see, "I got an order to arrest a man wandering around, claiming to be an officer. Sadly", everything points to you and there is no way it could be a mistake.
dlga_uciekinier_b1:uciekinier_c1|{playername}, we've known each other for a long time, I won't deny what you're saying, just allow me to explain myself.
dlga_uciekinier_c1:uciekinier_c2|Some time ago I and madam X, a lady close to my heart, were at a ball held by one of the magnates and one of the most hardline Targowica backers. There was a lot of Targowica supporters, as well as a lot of Russian officers. I was to eavesdrop and overhear as much as I could.
dlga_uciekinier_c2:uciekinier_c3|Not all went according to my plan, someone recognized me and captured us. What was I to do when they threatened X? I had to take their conditions. 
dlga_uciekinier_c3:uciekinier_d1|In exchange for her life they demanded I spy for them in a disguise of an officer. Which is why I'm in this place.
dlga_uciekinier_d1:uciekinier_d2|I will help you.
dlga_uciekinier_d2:uciekinier_d22|I can help you.
dlga_uciekinier_d22:uciekinier_d222|How could you? As soon as I stop sending in the reports, they will kill her.
dlga_uciekinier_d222:uciekinier_d2222|To accomplish anything, you have to be free, first.
dlga_uciekinier_d2222:uciekinier_d22222|What can we do?
dlga_uciekinier_d22222:uciekinier_d5|We'll find someone to take your place.
dlga_uciekinier_d5:uciekinier_help|I'll find some lowlife and send him in your stead. You will wait here, meanwhile, and I'll be back in a couple of days.
dlga_uciekinier_d22222:uciekinier_d6|You will give me your uniform as a proof of your death.
dlga_uciekinier_d6:uciekinier_help|You will give me your uniform, I will take it along with the message of your demise. You will meanwhile wait here, I'll be back in a few days.
dlga_uciekinier_help:close_window|Agreed {playername}, I will wait, but no longer than a couple of days.
dlga_uciekinier_d1:uciekinier_d3|I understand, but it changes nothing.
dlga_uciekinier_d3:uciekinier_d33|I understand, but I cannot allow private interests from triumph over the good of the nation.
dlga_uciekinier_d33:uciekinier_d333|I will not waste my chance of saving X.
dlga_uciekinier_d333:uciekinier_d3333|I am to duel with a convict?
dlga_uciekinier_d3333:uciekinier_tukaj_duel|There's no other solution, let's end this here and now.
dlga_uciekinier_tukaj_duel:uciekinier_tukaj_duel2|I'll give you the possibility of choice, pistols or rapiers?

dlga_uciekinier_tukaj_explain:uciekinier_c1|Allow me to explain, then.
dlga_uciekinier_tukaj_pojedynek:close_window|Let us begin, if there's no other way for us.
dlga_uciekinier_first_tukaj:uciekinier_a2|I am to drink with a traitor?
dlga_uciekinier_a2:uciekinier_a22|I see, our paths didn't cross by accident. Won't you ask for the reason?
dlga_uciekinier_a22:uciekinier_f1|I'm not interested in the reason.
dlga_uciekinier_f1:uciekinier_tukaj_duel3|Bad choice {playername}. I cannot waste my chance of saving X. I see but one path for us. A duel.
dlga_uciekinier_tukaj_duel3:uciekinier_tukaj_duel4|I give you the possibility of choice, pistols or rapiers?
dlga_uciekinier_tukaj_duel4:uciekinier_tukaj_pojedynek|Pistols.
dlga_uciekinier_tukaj_duel4:uciekinier_tukaj_pojedynek.1|Rapiers.
dlga_uciekinier_tukaj_duel4:uciekinier_tukaj_explain|What X are you talking about?
dlga_uciekinier_a22:uciekinier_c1|Speak quickly.
dlga_uciekinier_first3:uciekinier_first4|Hmm... if you insist, then let's go. I would like to rest in a {s0} tavern. Do you have anything against that?
dlga_uciekinier_first4:close_window|Not at all. I would gladly empty a tankard or two. Let's go.
dlga_prowokuj:prowokuj_0|{s20}, 
dlga_prowokuj_0:prowokuj_1|New taxes.
dlga_prowokuj_1:prowokuj_1_2|Allegedly new taxes are to be introduced, according to my uncle's friend, and he's a full-blooded beaurocrat, he knows everything, about what, how and when.
dlga_prowokuj_1_2:close_window|Whatever, I'm only here in passing.
dlga_prowokuj_0:prowokuj_2|Ban on the weapon trade.
dlga_prowokuj_2:prowokuj_2_2|My uncle told me, and he's a high-ranked beaurocrat, that the government plans to introduce new taxes on imports and gunsmiths, so that they couldn't sell weapons cheaply.
dlga_prowokuj_2_2:close_window|Really? Goddamn, I'm lucky, I'm well-stocked on weapons. But either way, I'll tell the other noblemen to arm themselves just in case.
dlga_prowokuj_0:prowokuj_3|The revocation of the impoverished nobility's rights.
dlga_prowokuj_3:prowokuj_3_2|My uncle told me, and he's a high-ranked beaurocrat, that the government plans to take away the impoverished nobility's right, apparently to prevent revolts.
dlga_prowokuj_3_2:close_window|What?! This cannot be! How could they, it's a scandal! That is sure to result in a riot! Thank you for the news, I will rush to inform everyone who needs to be informed.
dlga_prowokuj_1:prowokuj_1_2.1|My uncle told me, and he's a high-ranked beaurocrat, that the government plans to introduce new taxes on imports and gunsmiths, so that they couldn't sell weapons cheaply.
dlga_prowokuj_1_2:close_window.1|Bandits! We will not allow them to rob us of more than they already do! We'd sooner take up the arms! Thank you for the information, I will make sure to inform other merchants and townsmen!
dlga_prowokuj_0:prowokuj_2.1|Ban on trade.
dlga_prowokuj_2:prowokuj_2_2.1|It is said around the city, that there will be a ban on trade, or at least a crackdown on the liberties, to eliminate shady weapons and alcohol trading. They say the wares of a couple of merchants were already comandeered.
dlga_prowokuj_2_2:close_window.1|A ban on trade?! How could they, they will ruin us all completely, my whole family lives on what I earn from trade. But we'll show the bastards!
dlga_prowokuj_0:prowokuj_3.1|Law changes.
dlga_prowokuj_3:prowokuj_3_2.1|Allegedly the law is about to change and they will ban public assembly for now... that's what my uncle told me, and he knows what's going on around.
dlga_prowokuj_3_2:close_window.1|May they have to stand in line for some room in hell! Divine punishment will come to them, rest assured.
dlga_prowokuj_1:prowokuj_1_2.2|One of my high-ranked friends told me, they are about to introduce new taxes on common goods and textiles.niedobrze dzieje się w państwie...

dlga_prowokuj_2_2:close_window.2|Eh, "the populace sure won't allow it. I'll tell anyone I met what you said, though."
dlga_prowokuj_3:prowokuj_3_2.2|They say, that the rights of the local people are about to be limited, apparently a law is about to be passed, as my uncle told me, and he's really knowledgeable in these matters.
dlga_prowokuj_3_2:close_window.2|They can't limit it more than it already is, and thank God, I'm not a local anyway.
dlga_event_triggered:close_window.2|You've done better than I expected... report our victory to the camp.
dlga_event_triggered:close_window.3|Ha, it was to be expected, we'd lose with support like that... report our defeat to the camp.
dlga_event_triggered:zdarzenie1_1|Mister commander, I don't want a rebellion, I'm fighting on, not getting enough sleep or food for a wage like that. The times are hard so I don't complain much.
dlga_zdarzenie1_1:close_window|But hell, I'll be damned, if I have to tolerate these boors from the forest one more day! They drink surreptitiously and steal our food when we sleep, the bastards!

dlga_qdlugi_odbierz12:close_window|Well, well. Speak more quietly, will you? I'm paying it back, without the interest, but the borrowed sum to a penny. That's all I can afford.

You have done a great job assisting Hungarians' efforts in preparing the revolt and your efforts will not be in vain, as news are flowing from Hungary of an upcoming, armed insurgency against Habsburgs' rule.
dlga_start:kosciuszko_first_talk2.1|Greetings, {s69} {playername}? It is good to see you, I heard, that as an emissary you have bravely supported the Hungarians in the preparations for the revolt. Although not all goals were fulfilled, "jednak wkrótce możemy oczekiwać zbrojnego wystąpienia przeciw tyranii Habsburskiej. we can still expect an armed insurrection against the Habsburg tyranny, ", 
dlga_start:kosciuszko_first_talk2.2|Greetings, {s69} {playername}? It is good to see you, I heard, that as an emissary you have bravely supported the Hungarians in the preparations for the revolt. Unfortunately, your engagement did not produce the effects desired. According to the latest news, the plan of the revolt needs to be delayed.
"dlga_kosciuszko_first_talk2:close_window|For your services, I promote you to a Lieutenant. Before you set off make sure to gather new soldiers.", nieopodal stąd jest obóz wojskowy. Melduj się później u mnie.

dlga_qzdrada1:close_window|Excellent, that's just what I expected of you!
dlga_kosciuszko_quest:zdrajcy1|Then listen well, after we've taken the cities, many Targowica traitors will attempt to hide of flee the Rzeczypospolita. But they're gonna need help.
dlga_zdrajcy1:zdrajcy2|Go to the cities, after they have been taken by our armies, try to catch at least some of them. Each and every single one you catch is to be handed over to the city watch.
dlga_zdrajcy2:close_window|They're gonna have to wait for the end of the insurrection and a just trial in prison.
dlga_kosciuszko_quest:close_window|aaaaa, 
dlga_kosciuszko_quest:qodbijsapiehe|{playername}, in an unfortunate turn of event our great ally {s0} had been taken prisoner. As fate would have it, he was abducted by highwaymen on the way from Warsaw to Krakow.
dlga_qodbijsapiehe:close_window|They are waiting for ransom near the tavern 'Rome'. Unfortunately our treasury is empty, so do all you can to rescue him from their hands. It is important he is back and on his position as soon as possible.
dlga_kosciuszko_quest:close_window.1|See {playername}, the enemy is sending emissaries to our lands trying to turn the peasants against us. I've received a message, "that one of them is currently in a tavern. Capture him and deliver to the prison in Warsaw. If he resists, do not hesitate to eliminate him.", 
dlga_kosciuszko_quest:qinfiltracja1|I have a bit of a problem {playername}, as usual during wartime, a lot of bandits started showing up on the roads lately, but a band led by Grzegorz Opalonko is particularly problematic. Emissaries reported, he is cooperating with Russian troops supporting the Targowica Confederates and report our forces positions and manpower.
dlga_qinfiltracja1:close_window|It needs to be dealt with. According to the information that reached me, they often stay at the tavern {s20}. Learn where they hide during the day, the ringleader is to be captured and delivered to me alive.
dlga_kosciuszko_quest:uniwersal|As you know the aim of our fight are not temporary changes or short-term improvement. We need a reform of treasury, army, and before all others providing care and liberties to the peasantry.
dlga_uniwersal:uniwersal_a|It is in their hands that the fate of the Rzeczypospolita lies, if the peasants support the insurrection, not only will the country regain independence, but we will also be able to reach equality of all estates bloodlessly.
dlga_uniwersal_a:close_window|It is crucial that the news reach the peasants rapidly, so you will go and read the manifesto in villages.
dlga_kosciuszko_quest:nadszedl_czas_0|Since you've taken command of the regiment entrusted to you, you can get ready to go on your way. There's fighting over cities that our of utmost importance to us since several days, but the news of the insurrection has not reached everyone yet. You will go to the fortification of {s20}, finding there a garrison composed of Polish soldiers, tell them the news and the order to join the insurrection.
dlga_nadszedl_czas_0:close_window|Watch out, there may be Russian patrols nearby.
dlga_kosciuszko_quest:bwpbmr2|In a couple of days we're planning to strike and retake Warsaw from Russian hands, the locals surely will majorly aid us, but that's not all we need, in order to be able to achieve full success.
dlga_bwpbmr2:kosciuszko_quest|The orders are, as follows: you will go towards Warsaw. Most likely in the following days there will be fighting nearby and the leades of the Targowica Confederacy will attempt to flee. Capture them and deliver to the capital. They will await their trial there.
dlga_kosciuszko_quest:close_window.2|And now {playername} I have new orders for you. We need you to capture one of the {s20} officers. Once you accomplish that, bring him here. He will certainly have useful information, that will be of great use during combat...
dlga_kosciuszko_quest:niesubordynacja|It is needed to know {playername}, that despite the recent victories, not everything is happening to our liking. A marked demoralization has crept into several troops, resulting in insubordination, and even desertion.
dlga_niesubordynacja:niesubordynacja1|The gravest of those is the disappearance of one of the particularly martial scythemen, a man called Ensign Swistacki. This man, despite having bravely stood and risked his life more than once in the first row, for some time is drifting around and bragging about his deeds, instead of taking care of his duties.
dlga_niesubordynacja1:close_window|I've sent some men after him, but for no avail. We can no longer allow excesses like that to ruin order, annihilate discipline. Take care of that.

dlga_qprzewrot_5_2:qprzewrot_6|I think, that's enough.
dlga_qprzewrot_6:qprzewrot_end|I think, that's enough. At the orders of the leader of the revolution, Alexander Radishchev, I demand you surrender and submit to a trial.

dlga_przquest:qem1|See {playername}, we've sent emissaries in the country, they were going to spread the revolutionary ideals among the common folk. But lately I found out, that one of our men operating in {s20} and the area nearby is under enemy observation, and this means, that he may be captured at any time, especially when someone contacts him.
dlga_qem1:qem2|We cannot let this happen, so go to {s20} and help him escape. He lives in the suburbs, hmmm... in a... house of fleshly pleasures, you know.... rules of a conspiracy. You should easily recognize the place.

Infiltrate {s22} and get him, before he carries out his plan or we're doomed!
dlga_przquest:close_window.4|I must acknowledge with shame, not all volounteers turn out to be as dedicated to the cause as you {playername}. Recently we've had a large group of marauders leave the marching column. The blackguards have been carrying out rapes and robberies for several days, terrorizing the neighboring villages. Eventually they attacked a commissar bearing the wages for one of the regiments. Find them, execute them and try to recover the funds.

dlga_zad2e2dp2:zad2e2dp22f|Mister Niemcewicz, was sent to organize a certain mission, designed to weaken our enemy, so that we have better chances once the insurrection breaks out.

dlga_zad2e2dp22f:close_window|See {playername} it might have evaded your notice, but we've been tailed since we left the tavern. They even followed us here, so it seems to me they will be nearby. Take care of them.

dlga_zad2ps3:zad2ps3say1|Of course, I'm a nobleman, but...

dlga_zad2ps4:close_window|I can offer you many things, but before that happens, you will need a material proof of your nobility. Your word is valuable to me, but among us nobility, a document is of utmost importance.

dlga_zadanie2pow:zadanie2gpyt|You may, I've been going to Vienna in the name of General Kosciuszko with a diplomatic mission. As you likely heard from the gossip or other rumors, an armed insurgency against the invader is soon to occur. Before the time of vengeance is here, we're planning to reach an agreement with the Habsburg Monarchy.

dlga_start:close_window.32|No time to waste, get moving quick.
dlga_start:prolog_5_0|Welcome, I'm glad to be able to be hosting you in my humble abode. Thanks again for saving my life.
dlga_prolog_5_0:prolog_5_1a|Nolens volens, you've been pulled into a conflict, in which you might do a great service to the Fatherland. When we met in the tavern, I've been returning from a mission as a deputy of the Patriotic Faction. The people fighting to liberate the Commonwealth from the treacherous rule of Targowica and enemy powers' paid shills.
dlga_prolog_5_1a:prolog_5_1|So far the attempts to liberate the land from Tsar's rule were as you know unsuccessful. But this time we're wiser for the experience and planning an insurrection. Even more, a popular levy of all the estates.
dlga_prolog_5_1:prolog_5_2|Feel free to ask questions, I owe you an explanation, and there's many things you ought to know too...
dlga_prolog_5_2:prolog_5_2_0_0|Tell me more about the conspirators' plans.
dlga_prolog_5_2_0_0:prolog_5_2_0_1|So I will, since I took part in formulating it myself.
dlga_prolog_5_2_0_1:prolog_5_2_0_2|As you might have guessed, we're preparing an insurrection in the Commonwealth. I can't divulge too many details, especially not right now, but I will tell you what's necessary. To guarantee the success of future actions we need to look support by any means available, both within, Not to search too far on Hungary a conspiracy against the Habsburg rule is being organized. It should weaken the forces of our common enemies greatly and with some luck lead to both us and our allies regaining our freedom.
dlga_prolog_5_2_0_2:prolog_5_2|That is certainly not a small risk, you could even say the plan is insane, but in it lies the hope for Commonwealth to regain its freedom.
dlga_prolog_5_2:prolog_5_2_1_0|Tell me more about the causes of the current situation.
dlga_prolog_5_2_1_0:prolog_5_2_0_1a|Well, {playername}, we ourselves are to blame, too many years without reforms, corruption amongst magnates, greed and sloth, all of those, causes of our fall. Not that the noble freedom was not the thorn in neighboring powers' sides for a long time. It all began with king Sobieski's death.after his death all the feuds and strife took off, not reforms.
dlga_prolog_5_2_0_1a:prolog_5_2_0_2a|With each year the influence of Russian Empire rose, it was the time of internal strife, poor rule of the Saxons, then king Stanislaw. In 1768 the nobility confederated against the king and the increasing influence of the Russian Empire. As you might guess, four years of internal fighting weakened the country greatly.
dlga_prolog_5_2_0_2a:prolog_5_2_0_3a|Finally in 1772, I remember like it was yesterday, I was young then... in aforesaid year 1772, the Empress along with the King of Prussia and Emperor Francis II signed a pact of partition, with the Sejm's allowing it. I then left the country to study in Padua, so I didn't know what happened, but when I returned it was even worse. The last attempt to change our situation was an attempt to introduce a Constitution, but the initial success ended with the Targowica Confederacy and the war with Russia.
dlga_prolog_5_2_0_3a:prolog_5_2_0_4a|I fought with Kosciuszko in Dubienka, what a battle! We fought them off marvellously! But for naught. The king joined the Confederates, and the Sejm once again under the duress of an army carried out a partition.
dlga_prolog_5_2_0_4a:prolog_5_2|And today, this is our last chance... but well, that's pretty much all there is to know, and you probably know it already.
dlga_prolog_5_2:prolog_5_2_2_0|Tell me why were you delegated to Vienna.
dlga_prolog_5_2_2_0:prolog_5_2|Our mission was to negotiate the Austrian neutrality towards the insurrection. The results of the mission will however be uncertain until the end, we didn't receive any guarantees.
dlga_prolog_5_2:prolog_5_2_3_0|So I know everything I need.
dlga_prolog_5_2_3_0:prolog_5_2_3_1|If you know all you need, then before we can talk about the future, there's something that needs to be done. We suspect, that the thugs you beat up, is not everyone that has been following us, 
dlga_prolog_5_2_3_1:close_window|I've seen three suspicious-looking people pottering around nearby, similar to the ones seen earlier in the tavern. Whether they fled somewhere, or hid I don't know, but we need to make sure, that they are not a threat. I hope, that you and Grzegorz, who you probably met already, can take care of that.
dlga_start:zadanie2o1|Welcome, I'm glad to be able to be hosting you in my humble abode.

dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|A trader? Oh, aye, I certainly am that. My merchandise is a bit different from most, however. It has to be fed and watered twice a day and tries to run away if I turn my back.
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|Livestock?
dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Close enough. I like to call myself the man who keeps every boat on this ocean moving. Boats are driven by oars, you see, and oars need men to pull them or they stop. That's where I come in.
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|Galley slaves.
dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Now you're catching on! A trading port like this couldn't survive without them. The ships lose a few hands on every voyage, so there's always a high demand. The captains come to me and they pay well.
dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|Where do the slaves come from?
dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|Mostly I deal in convicted criminals bought from the authorities. Others are prisoners of war from various nations, brought to me because I offer the best prices. However, on occasion I'll buy from privateers and other . . . 'individuals'. You can't be picky about your suppliers in this line of work. You wouldn't happen to have any prisoners with you, would you?
dlga_ramun_introduce_9:ramun_introduce_10|Me?
dlga_ramun_introduce_10:ramun_introduce_11|Why not? If you intend to set foot outside this town, you're going to cross swords with someone sooner or later. And, God willing, you'll come out on top. Why not make some extra money off the whole thing? Take them alive, bring them back to me, and I'll pay you fifty denars for each head. Don't much care who they are or where they come from.
dlga_ramun_introduce_11:ramun_introduce_12|Hmm. I'll think about it.
dlga_ramun_introduce_12:close_window|Do think about it! There's a lot of silver to be made, no mistake. More than enough for the both of us.
dlga_start:ramun_talk|Hello, {playername}.
dlga_ramun_pre_talk:ramun_talk|Anything else?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|I've brought you some prisoners, Ramun. Would you like a look?
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Let me see what you have...
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|A pleasure doing business with you.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|How do I take somebody as prisoner?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing.1|Can you tell me again about capturing prisoners?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|You're new to this, aren't you? Let me explain it in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? I'm assuming you have a blunt weapon with you . . .
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Of course.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|As a matter of fact, I don't.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Good. Then all you need to do is beat the bugger down with your weapon, and when the fighting's over you clap him in irons. It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp. I don't have many requirements in my merchandise, but I do insist they be breathing when I buy them.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|No? Heh, well, this must be your lucky day. I've got an old club lying around that I was going to throw away. It a bit battered, but still good enough bash someone until he stops moving. Here, have it.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Thanks, Ramun. Perhaps I may try my hand at it.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Alright, I'll try and expain it again in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp, 
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|Alright, I think I understand. Anything else?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|Well, it's not as simple as all that. Blunt weapons don't do as much damage as sharp ones, so they won't bring your enemies down as quickly. And trust me, given the chance, most of the scum you run across would just as soon kill you as look at you, so don't expect any courtesy when you pull out a club instead of a sword. Moreover, having to drag prisoners to and fro will slow down your party, which is why some people simply set their prisoners free after the fighting's done. It's madness. How could anyone turn down all that silver, eh?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|Is that everything?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|Just one final thing. Managing prisoners safely is not an easy thing to do, you could call it a skill in itself. If you want to capture a lot of prisoners, you should try and learn the tricks of it yourself, or you won't be able to hang on to a single man you catch.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_leave|I'd better be going.
dlga_ramun_leave:close_window|Remember, any prisoners you've got, bring them to me. I'll pay you good silver for every one.

dlga_pretender_quit_rebel_confirm_4:supported_pretender_pretalk|Let me think about this some more.
dlga_pretender_quit_rebel:close_window|So be it. Then my cause is lost. There is only one thing to do for me now. I will go from Calradia and never come back. With me gone, you may try to make your peace with {s4}.
dlga_supported_pretender_talk:supported_pretender_equip|{reg65?My lady:My lord}, would you allow me to check out your equipment?
dlga_supported_pretender_equip:supported_pretender_pretalk|Very well, it's all here...
dlga_supported_pretender_talk:pretneder_view_char_requested|If it would please you, can you tell me about your skills?
dlga_pretneder_view_char_requested:supported_pretender_pretalk|Well, all right.
dlga_supported_pretender_talk:supported_pretender_grant_fief|I suggest that you decide who should hold a fief that does not have a lord.

dlga_member_chat:member_talk|Yes, {s5}?
dlga_member_talk:member_direct_campaign|As marshal, I wish you to send a message to the vassals of the realm
dlga_member_talk:zdarzenie1_2|I've received a complaint about you.
dlga_zdarzenie1_2:zdarzenie1_3|Your brothers in arms claim, that you and your companions drink on duty and shamelessly steal food.
dlga_zdarzenie1_3:zdarzenie1_4|We? Steal? They're lying good sir, pay them no heed! It's them who are screwing around on every stop without measure. We're scared for our own butts now and can't sleep at night. I understand that sometimes you just must do things, but all that debauchery will end up with the clap and that's that... and about the vodka, yeah, true... but not much, raise our wages by 100 zlotys and we won't touch hooch for sure.
dlga_zdarzenie1_4:close_window|Agreed.
dlga_zdarzenie1_4:zdarzenie1_5_2|It's unbecoming, changing a contract like that.
dlga_zdarzenie1_5_2:close_window|True, true. Fine, the deal stands and we'll cut back on the drinking...
dlga_zdarzenie1_5_2:zdarzenie1_4|It's compensation for moral losses, I hope you understand...
dlga_zdarzenie1_4:zdarzenie1_5_3|No deal.
dlga_zdarzenie1_5_3:close_window|I unfortunately can't raise your pay...
dlga_member_talk:member_trade|Let me see your equipment.
dlga_member_trade:do_member_trade|Very well, it's all here...
dlga_member_talk:view_member_char_requested|What can you tell me about your skills?
dlga_view_member_char_requested:do_member_view_char|All right, let me tell you...
dlga_member_talk:member_separate|We need to separate for a while.
dlga_member_separate:member_separate_confirm|Oh really? Well, I'm not just going to wait around here. I'm going to go to the towns to look for other work. Is that what you want?
dlga_member_separate:companion_quitting|Well, actually, there was something I needed to tell you.
dlga_member_separate_confirm:member_separate_yes|That's right. We need to part ways.
dlga_member_separate_confirm:do_member_trade|No, I'd rather have you at my side.
dlga_member_separate_yes:close_window|Well. I'll be off, then. Look me up if you need me.
dlga_member_talk:member_question|I'd like to ask you something.
dlga_member_talk:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_member_question:member_question_2|Very well. What did you want to ask?
dlga_member_question_2:member_morale|How do you feel about the way things are going in this company?
dlga_member_question_2:member_background_recap|Tell me your story again.
dlga_member_question_2:member_kingsupport_1|I suppose you know that I aspire to be {king/queen} of this land?
dlga_member_question_2:member_intelgathering_1|Do you have any connections that we could use to our advantage?

dlga_member_background_recap_2:member_background_recap_3|{s5},

dlga_do_member_view_char:member_talk|Anything else?
dlga_member_kingsupport_1:do_member_trade|Um... Yes. I had heard.
dlga_member_kingsupport_1:member_kingsupport_1a|{s21}, 
dlga_member_kingsupport_1a:member_kingsupport_2|Would you then support my cause?
dlga_member_kingsupport_1a:do_member_trade|Very good. I shall keep that in mind.
dlga_member_kingsupport_2:do_member_trade|I would, {s21}. Moreover, I have a proposal on how I might help you attain your throne. But you recently sent {s22} off on a similar mission. Perhaps we should wait for a couple of weeks to avoid drawing too much attention to ourselves.

dlga_member_kingsupport_3:member_kingsupport_3a|{s21}, 
dlga_member_kingsupport_3a:member_kingsupport_4|Very good. You do that, 
dlga_member_kingsupport_3a:do_member_trade|On second thought, stay with me for a while
dlga_member_kingsupport_4:close_window|Farewell then, {s21}, for a little while, 
dlga_member_intelgathering_1:member_intelgathering_3|{s21}, 
dlga_member_intelgathering_3:member_intelgathering_3|Of course, as few people should know of this as possible. If you want to collect the information, or pull me out, then don't send a messenger. Come and get me yourself -- even if that means you have to sneak through the gates.
dlga_member_intelgathering_3:member_intelgathering_4|Splendid idea -- you do that.
dlga_member_intelgathering_3:do_member_trade|Actually, hold off for now.
dlga_member_intelgathering_4:close_window|Good. I should be ready to report in about five days. Farewell then, {s21}, for a little while.
dlga_merchant_quest_4_start:close_window|It's time, lads! Up and at them!
dlga_start:relative_saved_1a|Thank you! Thank you, {sir/my lady}, for rescuing me from those fiends. Did my brother in {s9} put you onto their track?
dlga_relative_saved_1a:close_window|Yes. I told him that I would find you. I advise you to return to your family as quickly as you can -- and be careful on the road.
dlga_start:bandit_leader_1a|Ay! Spare me! Spare my life! Let me go, and I'll go far away from here, and learn an honest trade, and you'll never hear of me again!
dlga_bandit_leader_1a:bandit_leader_1b|I'll spare your life -- but in exchange, I want information. Either you or your mates kidnapped the brother of a prominent merchant in town. Tell me where you're hiding him, and give me your word that you'll stop troubling the people of these parts, and you can go free.
dlga_start:looter_leader_1|What do you want?
dlga_looter_leader_1:looter_leader_2|I've been looking for you. Tell me where you keep your prisoners, and I'll let you go.
dlga_looter_leader_1:close_window|Nothing. We'll leave you in peace.
dlga_looter_leader_2:looter_leader_3|Hah! Those prisoners are only going free if you pay their ransom. Did you bring any silver?
dlga_looter_leader_3:close_window|No, but I brought steel.
dlga_bandit_leader_1b:close_window|Oh bless you, {sir/my lady}. Bless you. We've done the lad no harm. We've been keeping him in our hideout near {s9}. I'll describe the area nearby in detail, so there's no mistaking it...
dlga_start:rescue_prisoner_succeed_2|{playername}, you saved him! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.
dlga_rescue_prisoner_succeed_2:lord_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.
dlga_start_up_quest_1_next:close_window|Are you all right? Well.... I guess you're alive, at any rate. I'm not sure that we can say the same for the other fellow. That's one less thief to trouble our streets at night, although Heaven knows he won't be the last.... Anyway, maybe you can help me with something. Let's talk more inside. Out here, we don't know who's listening, 
dlga_start:merchant_quest_2a|Splendid work. You have hired enough men to take on the bandits. Now -- travellers entering {s9} have told us that there is a small group of robbers lurking on the outside of town. I suspect that they are all from the same band, the one that took my brother. Hunt them down and defeat them, and make them disclose the location of their lair!
dlga_start:merchant_quest_3a|So, you've found out where they hid my brother? Splendid work. I flatter myself that I'm a fine judge of character, and you look to be a {man/woman} who can get things done. Now, go out and save his unworthy hide!
dlga_start:merchant_quest_3b|Well... My brother is home safe. I'm not sure what to do with him -- maybe pack him off to a university outside Calradia. That way, if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl, no one can say it's my fault. But that's not your problem. Here's the rest of your reward. It was well-earned.
dlga_merchant_quest_3b:merchant_quest_4a|The money is most welcome, and I am glad to have been of service
dlga_merchant_quest_4a:merchant_quest_4b|Good! Now... Are you interested in making some more?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b:merchant_quest_4b1|Possibly. What do you need?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b1:merchant_quest_4b2|Remember how I told you that the bandits had an ally inside the walls? I think I know who it is -- the captain of the watch, no less. Some months ago this captain, seeing the amount of profit we merchants were making from trade across the frontiers, decided to borrow some money to sponsor a caravan. Unfortunately, like many who are new to commerce, he failed to realize that great profit only comes with great risk. So he sank all his money into the most expensive commodities, and of course his caravan was captured and looted, and he lost everything.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b2:merchant_quest_4b3|As a consequence, it seems, our captain turned to villainy to recoup his fortune. I supposed I'd do the same if, the Heavens forbid, I ever faced indebtedness and ruination. Now, any watch captain worth his salary will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll, to inform on the rest, but our captain decides to employ these bastards wholesale. He brings them into the town, lets them do as they will, and takes a share of their take. You've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers? Well, in the unfortunate land of Calradia, sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher. Luckily, there's are still a few brave, honest souls in the watch who've told me how he works.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b3:merchant_quest_4b4|Now -- here's my plan. I could bring this to the attention of {s4}, lord of the city, but that would mean an inquiry, my word against the captain's, and witnesses can be bought and evidence destroyed, or maybe the whole thing will be forgotten if the enemy comes across the border again, and all I'll get for my trouble is a knife in the ribs. In time of war, you see, a king's eye wanders far from his domain, and his subjects suffer. So I've got another idea. I've got a small group of townsfolk together, some men in my employ and some others who've lost relatives to these bandits, and we'll storm the captain's home and bring him in chains before {s4}, hopefully with a few captured bandits to explain how things stack up, 
dlga_merchant_quest_4b4:merchant_quest_4b5|All I need now is someone to lead my little army into battle -- and I can't think of anyone better than you. So, what do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b5:merchant_quest_4b6|How do I know that you're telling me the truth?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b6:merchant_quest_4b7|Oh, well, I suppose it's possible that I found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing stranger a false impression of life in old {s4}... Well, I guess you can't really know if my word is good, but I reckon you've learned by now that my money is good, and there's another 100 denars, or maybe a bit more, that's waiting for you if you'll do me this last little favor. So what do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4b8|All right. I'll lead your men.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4_decline|I'm sorry. This is too much, too fast. I need time to think.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b8:merchant_quest_4b9|Splendid. It's been a long time since I staked so much on a single throw of the dice, and frankly I find it exhilarating. My men are ready to move on your word. Are you ready?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_accept|Yes. Give them the sign.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_decline|Not now. I will need to rest before I can fight again.
dlga_merchant_quest_4_accept:close_window|Good! Now -- strike hard, strike fast, and the captain and his henchmen won't know what hit them. May the heavens be with you!
dlga_merchant_quest_4_decline:close_window|Right. I can keep my men standing by. If you let this go too long, then I suppose that I shall have to finish this affair without you, but I would be most pleased if you could be part of it as well. For now, take what time you need.
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window|Very well. I shall hunt for bandits.
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome|Why don't you come with us?
dlga_merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome:merchant_quest_2a|Because I'm paying you to go take care of it. That's the short answer. The long answer is that I've got some leads to follow up here in town, and I have just as much chance of getting knocked on my head as you, if that's what you're asking. But I respect your question. Now, what do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window.1|I cannot deal with this matter at this time.
dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window|Very well. I go now to attack the bandits in their lair, and find your brother.
dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window.1|I cannot deal with this matter at this time.
dlga_start:merchant_quest_persuasion|You may do as you wish, {sir/my lady}, but I am disappointed. You would do well to reconsider. I am a rich men, and would show you my gratitude in coin.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_1_prologue_3|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_2|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_3|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_4b8|You make a persuasive case. I will help you.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:close_window|As I say, I have more important business elsewhere.
dlga_merchant_quest_2:merchant_quest_2a|Now -- go find and defeat that group of bandits.
dlga_merchant_quest_3:merchant_quest_3a|Now -- go attack that bandit hideout, get my brother back, and show those brigands what happens to those who threaten my household.
dlga_start:close_window.67|Oh -- thank the heavens... Thank the heavens... Am I safe?
dlga_start:merchant_closing_statement_2|Ah... {playername}. Things didn't go quite so well as I had hoped. {s5} couldn't quite find it in him to overlook my little breach of the peace. Oh, he's grateful enough that I got rid of his crooked captain -- a guard who'll let in bandits will let in an enemy army, if the price is right -- but he can't exactly have me running around here as a lasting reminder of his failure to take care of things himself.
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_2:merchant_closing_statement_3|That hardly seems fair...
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_3:merchant_closing_statement_4|Fair? This is Calradia, {my boy/my lady}! Kings do what they will, and the rest of us do as they must. He didn't string me up, and instead gave me time to sell my properties -- even put in a word with the other merchants that they best pay me a fair price, too. That's gracious enough, as kings go -- but he's a weak king, as they all are here, and weak kings must always look to their authority first, and justice second. I suppose I'd do the same, in his shoes.
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_4:close_window|Anyway, I wouldn't go rubbing your part in this affair in {s5}'s face -- but he's taken note of you, and decided that you're not worth hanging, and that's something to which I'll raise a glass any day of the week. He might even have work for you, further down the road. Or, you can sell your sword to one of his competitors. Anyway, I hope you've learned a bit about what it will take to stay alive in this troubled land, and I suspect that the money you've earned won't go to waste. Good luck.
dlga_merchant_quests_last_word:close_window|I am preparing to leave town in a short while. It's been an honor to know you. Good luck.
dlga_member_intel_liaison:member_intel_liaison_results|What have you discovered?
dlga_start:member_intel_liaison|Greetings, stranger.
dlga_member_intel_liaison:close_window|It's time to pull you out. Let's leave town separately, but join me soon after
dlga_member_intel_liaison:close_window.1|You're doing good work. Stay here for a little longer, 
dlga_member_intel_liaison_results:member_intel_liaison|{s11} I notice that you have been keeping some notes about individual lords. I have annotated those with my findings.

dlga_qkp_konspirator_a:close_window|Excellent, it will be distributed among the insurgents. We'll await the signal to begin the struggle.

dlga_minister_issues:minister_pretalk|There is a matter which needs your attention. The quarrel between {s11} and {s12} has esclatated to a point where it has become unseemly. If you do intervene, you risk offending one of the lords. However, if you do nothing, you risk appearing weak. Such are the burdens of kingship, {sire/my lady}.
dlga_minister_issues:minister_talk|{s1} currently does not have a lord. You may wish to keep it this way, as lords will sometimes gravitate towards lieges who have land to offer, but for the time being, no one is collecting any of its rents.

I should point out though, sire, that I am not very skilled in the ways of politics, and that I am anxious to return to private life.

dlga_minister_issues:minister_talk.2|If I may offer you a world of advice, my {lord/lady}, it seems that your right to rule as an independent monarch is not sufficiently recognized, and this may bring us problems further down the road.

dlga_minister_indict_confirm:minister_indict_confirm_answer|Think carefully on this, {sire/my lady}. If you indict {s4} for treason unjustly, you may find that others become nervous about serving you.

dlga_event_triggered:companion_embassy_results|Well, {s21}, at last I've found you. I have returned from my mission to {s31}. In general, I would say, {s14}.
dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_rejoin_response|In this letter, {s12} addresses you as {Lord/Lady} of {s4}, which implies some sort of recognition that you are a sovereign and independent monarch.
dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_rejoin_response.1|In his letter, {s12} merely refers to you as {playername}, omitting any title. This does not constitute recognition of your right to rule.
dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_rejoin_response.2|{s12} says that your current truce should suffice.
dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_truce_confirm|{s12} says that he is willing to consider a truce of forty days.
dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_rejoin_response.3|{s12} says that he is unwilling to conclude a peace.
dlga_companion_truce_confirm:companion_rejoin_response|Very well - let this truce with the {s4} be concluded.
dlga_companion_truce_confirm:companion_rejoin_response.1|On second thought, perhaps this is currently not in our interests.
dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_rejoin_response.4|{s12} says that you are already pledged to another ruler.
dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_rejoin_response.5|{s12} says that he does not believe that you would honor your obligations as a vassal, and suspects that your offer is just a ploy.
dlga_companion_embassy_results:vassalage_offer_confirm|{s12} says that he accepts your offer of vassalage. He will give you 30 days to seek him out, in which time he will refrain from making war on you.

dlga_start:close_window.71|Well, {sir/my lady}! Please, do not trouble yourself to rise from the ground, as I would simply have to knock you down again. I shall take your silence as an apology. Good day to you.
dlga_start:close_window.72|Very well. You've made your point. I retract what I said. I hope you have obtained satisfaction.
dlga_start:close_window.73|Hah! Not so gallant now, are we? Now trouble me no more.

dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_1:pretender_discuss_rebellion_2a|Are you sure you will be up to the task, {playername}? Reclaiming my throne will be no simple matter. The lords of our realm have all sworn oaths of homage to {s11}. Such oaths to a usurper are of course invalid, and we can expect some of the lords to side with us, but it will be a very tough and challenging struggle ahead.

But I don't think we have much of a chance of success. If you can gain renown in the battlefield and make a name for yourself as a great commander, then our friends would not hesitate to join our cause, and our enemies would be wary to take up arms against us. When that time comes, I will come with you gladly. But until that time, it will be wiser not to openly challange the usurper, {s11}.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window.1|Haven't you already taken up the cause of {s17}? You must have a very strong sense of justice, indeed. But no, thank you. I will not be part of your game.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window.2|{playername}, you are already oath-bound to serve {s15}. As such, I cannot allow you to take up my cause, and let my enemies claim that I am but a mere puppet of {s16}. No, if I am to have the throne of {s17}, I must do it due to the righteousness of my cause and the support of my subjects alone.

dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window.3|You are a monarch in your own right, {sir/my lady}. If you were to back me, I would be merely your puppet.

The time is ripe for us to act! I will come with you, and together, we will topple the usurper {s11} and take the throne from his bloodied hands. But first, you must give me your oath of homage and accept me as your liege {reg65?lady:lord}.
dlga_pretender_rebellion_ready:lord_give_oath_2|I am ready to pledge myself to your cause, {reg3?my lady:sir}.

dlga_start:lord_invite_1|{playername}, I've been expecting you. Word has reached my ears of your exploits. Why, I keep hearing such tales of prowess and bravery that my mind was quickly made up. I knew that I had found someone worthy of becoming my vassal.

dlga_lord_invite_1:lord_invite_2.1|It is good to have my true value recognised.

dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_postponed|Let me think about this some more.
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected|No. I have decided that it would not be appropriate,

dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm|Do you mean to reject my suit outright, my lady?
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm_yes|Yes. I do.
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm:lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_postponed|No, you misunderstand. I just need some more time to think
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm_yes:close_window|Well, in that case, let me tell you something -- with those harsh words, you have removed the scales from my eyes. I would agree that it would not be appropriate for me to marry one such as you. Good day, my lady.
dlga_lord_female_pc_marriage_proposal_rejected_confirm_yes:close_window.1|Such is your right, my lady. If you ever wished to reconsider, I would be overwhelmed with joy.

dlga_lair_quest_intermediate_1:lord_pretalk|Splendid work, {playername} -- your audacious attack is the talk of the realm. No doubt they, or others like them, will soon be back, but for a short while you have bought this land a small respite. We are most grateful to you.
dlga_lair_quest_intermediate_2:lord_pretalk|Well, {playername}, I guess that at least some of those brigands eluded you -- and of course, it will be the peaceful travellers of this land who will pay the price. Still, it was good of you to try.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed|Your surgeon managed to convince my friend and made the operation.  The matter is in God's hands now and all we can do is pray for his recovery. Anyway, I thank you for lending your surgeon to me {sir/madam}. You have a noble spirit. I will not forget it.
dlga_lord_start:wedding_ceremony_bride_vow|May the heavens witness that I am ready to give you my {s11} {s4}, to have in marriage...
dlga_lord_start:lord_wedding_reschedule|It is good to see you, {playername}. We look forward to the wedding, as soon as we can all gather together for the feast.{s12}, 
dlga_lord_wedding_reschedule:lord_start|It is no problem. I can wait.
dlga_lord_wedding_reschedule:lord_return_dower|I have no faith that this wedding will be concluded. Please return my dower.
dlga_lord_return_dower:close_window|Well, that is your right, if you indeed have no confidence in our family's commitments. Take your money.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.1|Hah! Our little plot against {s3} worked perfectly, {playername}. The fool has lost one of his most valuable retainers, and we are one step closer to bringing him to his knees. Here, this purse contains {reg5} denars, and I wish you to have it. You deserve every copper. And, need I remind you, there could be much more to come if you've a mind to earn it..
dlga_lord_start:close_window|You werent't able to complete a simple task. I had set up everything. The only thing you needed to do was sacrifice a messenger, and we would be celebrating now. But no, you were too damned honorable, weren't you?
dlga_lord_start:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed|Have you brought me any news about that task I gave you? You know the one I mean...
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2|I have the reports you wanted right here.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2:lord_pretalk|Ahh, well done. It's good to have competent {men/people} on my side. Here is the payment I promised you.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk|Brilliant work, {playername}! Whatever you did, the nobles of the {s13} are clamoring for war! Soon, the time will come for us to reap the benefits of our hard work, from fields ripe for plunder. This war is going to make us rich, mark my words!
dlga_lord_start:lord_collect_debt_completed|I'm told that you've collected the money owed me from {s7}. Good, it's past time I had it back. I believe I promised to give you one-fifth of it all, eh? Well, that makes {reg3} denars, so if you give me my share -- that's {reg4} denars -- you can keep the rest.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_pay|Of course, {s65}. {reg4} denars, all here.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_pay:lord_pretalk|I must admit I'm impressed, {playername}. I had lost hope of ever getting this money back. Please accept my sincere thanks.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_no_pay|I am afraid I don't have the money with me sir.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_no_pay:close_window|Is this a joke? I know full well that {s7} gave you the money, and I want every denar owed to me, {sir/madam}. As far as I'm concerned, I hold you personally in my debt until I see that silver.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.1|I heard you got rid of that poxy merchant that was causing me so much grief. I can see you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? I like that in a {man/woman}. Here's your reward. Remember, {playername}, stick with me and we'll go a long, long way together.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.2|Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight to some poxy, lowborn merchant? Truly, if I ever need my guardsmen to take a lesson in how to lay down and die, I'll be sure to come to you. Just leave me be, {playername}, I have things to do.
dlga_lord_start:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go|You! Do you have sawdust between your ears? Did you think that when I said to kill the merchant, I meant you to have a nice chat with him and then let him go?! What possessed you?
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2|Sir, I made sure he will not act against you.
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2:lord_pretalk|Piffle. You were supposed to remove him, not give him a sermon and send him on his way. He had better do as you say, or you'll both regret it. Here, this is half the money I promised you. Don't say a word, {playername}, you're lucky to get even that. I have little use for {men/people} who cannot follow orders.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_completed|Beautiful work, {playername}! You captured both the spy and his handler, just as I'd hoped, and the pair are now safely ensconced in my dungeon, waiting to be questioned. My torturer shall be busy tonight! Anyway, I'm very pleased with your success, {playername}, and I give you this purse as a token of my appreciation.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {playername} -- what you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows, it was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important one of the pair. The spy will not dare return here and will prove quite useless to whatever master he served. 'Tis better than nothing. However, you'll understand if I pay you half the promised reward for what is but half a success.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy AND his handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_half_completed:lord_pretalk|I did my best, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_failed:lord_pretalk|Hrm. As you like, {s65}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.2|Splendid work, {playername}. All the serfs are back, properly cowed, and they're busy preparing for the harvest. You certainly earned your reward. Here, take it, with my compliments.
dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}. I have been waiting patiently for my serfs, yet none have returned. Have you an explanation? Were you outwitted by simple fieldhands, or are you merely incompetent? Or perhaps you are plotting with my enemies, intending to ruin me...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a|Forgive me, {s65}, those serfs were slippery as eels.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b|Perhaps if you had treated them better...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hmph, that is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to recruit new men to work these fields before we all starve.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b:close_window|Hah, now you reveal your true colours, traitor! Your words match your actions all too well. I should never have trusted you.
dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were 3 groups of serfs that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the serfs you returned, not the ones you let fly. Here. Take it, and let this business be done.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Bah, this proved to be a waste of my time.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deal_with_bandits_completed|{playername}, I was told that you have crushed the bandits at my village of {s5}. Please know that I am most grateful to you for that. Please, let me pay the expenses of your campaign. Here, I hope these {reg14} denars will be adequate.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.2|It was mere child's play.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.1|Damn it, {playername}. I heard that you were unable to drive off the bandits from my village of {s5}, and thanks to you, my village now lies in ruins. Everyone said that you were a capable warrior, but appearently, they were wrong.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank|Ah, {playername}. My quartermaster has informed me of your delivery, {reg13} heads of cattle, as I requested. I'm impressed.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk.2|Mere child's play.
dlga_lord_start:lord_scout_waypoints_thank|You make a good scout, {playername}. My runner just brought me your reports of the mission to {s13}, {s14} and {s15}. Well done.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk|A simple task, {s65}.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Nothing I couldn't handle.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.2|My pleasure, {s65}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army|The army's supplies are dwindling too quickly, {playername}. I need you to bring me {reg3} heads of cattle so I can keep the troops fed. I care very little about where you get them, just bring them to me as soon as you can.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted|Very well, I can find you some cattle.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected|Sorry, sir, I have other plans.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted:close_window|Excellent! You know what to do, {playername}, now get to it. I need that cattle sooner rather than later.
dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected:close_window|That . . . is unfortunate, {playername}. I shall have to find someone else who's up to the task. Please go now, I've work to do.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.2|Thank you for answering the summons, {playername}. However, as we are now at peace, we do not need your services. You may attend to your other business.
dlga_lord_start:lord_report_to_army_asked|Ah, you have arrived at last, {playername}. We've been expecting you. I hope you have brought with you troops of sufficient number and experience.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_completed|I have a company of good, hardened soldiers with me. We are ready to join you.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_asked:lord_report_to_army_continue|I don't have the sufficient number of troops yet. I will need some more time.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_completed:close_window|Excellent. We'll be moving soon. Now -- you are a {man/warrior} of sound judgement, and we trust that you will do what is necessary to support our campaign. I do not require you to remain close at hand, and I will not count it against you if you believe that your forces would be of better use elsewhere. But if you do choose to remain with me, to support me in battle, that would be appreciated. I may also have additional tasks for you to perform.
dlga_lord_report_to_army_continue:close_window|Then you'd better hurry. We'll be moving out soon against the enemy and I need every able hand we can muster.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints|{playername}, I need a volunteer to scout the area. We're sorely lacking on information, and I simply must have a better picture of the situation before we can proceed. I want you to go to {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and report back whatever you find.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted|You've found your volunteer, sir.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected|I fear I must decline.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted:close_window|Good {man/lass}! Simply pass near {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and check out what's there. Make a note of anything you find and return to me as soon as possible.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected:lord_pretalk|Hm. I'm disappointed, {playername}. Very disappointed. We'll talk later, I need to go and find somebody to scout for us.
dlga_lord_generic_mission_thank:lord_generic_mission_completed|You have been most helpful, {playername}. My thanks.
dlga_lord_generic_mission_completed:lord_pretalk|It was an honour to serve.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pay_debt_2|I think you owe me {reg1} denars, {playername}. Do you intend to pay your debt anytime soon?
dlga_lord_pay_debt_2:lord_pay_debt_3_1|That is why I came, {s65}. Here it is, every denar I owe you.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_2:lord_pay_debt_3_2|Alas, I don't have sufficient funds, {s65}. But I'll pay you soon enough.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_3_1:lord_pretalk|Ah, excellent. You are a {man/woman} of honour, {playername}. I am satisfied. Your debt to me has been paid in full.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_3_2:lord_pretalk|Well, don't keep me waiting much longer.
dlga_lord_start:lord_start.1|By the way, I hope you get a chance to meet my {s11}, {s14}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_start.2|By the way, I am sure that my {s11}, {s14}, would be delighted were you to pay her a visit. She awaits you in her chambers.
dlga_lord_start:lord_buy_prisoner|I heard that you have captured our enemy {s3} and he is with you at the moment. I can pay you {reg6} denars for him if you want to get rid of him. You can wait for his family to pay his ransom of course, but there is no telling how long that will take, eh?
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_accept|I accept your offer. I'll leave {s3} to you for {reg6} denars.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_deny|I fear I can't accept your offer.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_accept:lord_pretalk|Excellent! Here's your {reg6} denars. I'll send some men to take him to our prison with due haste.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_deny:lord_pretalk|Mmm. As you wish, {playername}, but you'll not get a better offer. Take it from me.
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk|I lift a {s5} to your health, {playername}! You are most gracious to host us on this occasion. Now, what is it?
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.1|To your health, {sire/your Highness}. Long may you reign. What is your bidding?
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.2|What is your bidding?
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.3|I wish to welcome you to my hall on this auspicious occasion. Now, what is it?
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk.4|Let us lift a {s5} to the health of our host, {s4}. Now, what is it?
dlga_lord_talk:offer_gift_quest_complete|I have the materials for {s4}'s gift.
dlga_offer_gift_quest_complete:close_window|Ah, let me take those. Hopefully this will mend the quarrel between you two. You may wish to speak to {reg4?her:him}, and see if I had any success.
dlga_lord_talk:intrigue_quest_state_complaint|My lord -- there is something I wish to tell you in confidence, about one of your vassals.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint:lord_pretalk|Whatever you have to say, I would ask you to wait until we are alone.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint:intrigue_quest_state_complaint_plyr|What is it? I value your opinion, although I hope that you are not trying to sew dissension among my vassals?
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_plyr:lord_intrigue_quest_complaint_stated|My liege -- {s4} is widely held by your vassals to be {s5}, and a liability to your realm
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_plyr:lord_pretalk|Actually, my liege, never mind.
dlga_lord_intrigue_quest_complaint_stated:lord_pretalk|Hmm... This is troubling to hear. Although I do not encourage my vassals to speak ill of each other, I value your opinion. Perhaps I should think twice about granting {s4} any further fiefs or offices...
dlga_lord_intrigue_quest_complaint_stated:intrigue_quest_state_complaint_failed|Sew discord among my vassals, will you? With everything else going on, do you think I appreciate my nobles turning on each other like quarreling dogs? Let me ask you this -- did someone put you up this?
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_failed:intrigue_quest_state_accept_blame|I stand by my words, my liege.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_complaint_failed:intrigue_quest_state_deflect_blame|Yes, sire -- {s4} put me up to denouncing {s5}!
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_accept_blame:lord_pretalk|Indeed. You may stand by your words, but keep them to yourself. I will not have you undercutting my faithful follower {s4}.
dlga_intrigue_quest_state_deflect_blame:lord_pretalk|I thought as much. Here's some advice for you, {lad/lassie} -- don't meddle in the quarrels of others. Now, enough of this.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_denounce_1|I want to tell you something -- we have had enough of your {s4} ways, 
dlga_lord_denounce_1:lord_denounce_2|I'm sorry... What did you say?
dlga_lord_denounce_2:lord_denounce_3|You heard me. You will {s4}, 
dlga_lord_denounce_2:lord_pretalk|Never mind. You must have misheard me.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:close_window|Why would you say such a thing? To insult me like this, in spite of our friendship -- how much crueler is a knife in my back from an erstwhile friends, than the sword of a sworn foe. I do not know what game you are playing, but I want no part of it. Go away. I do not want to look at you.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:close_window.1|Hmf. Really? Is that your opinion, or did one of my rivals put those words in your mouth? Never mind. I will not play your game. Go away, and take your intrigues with you.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:lord_denounce_4|I will not have you shame me in public, {sir/my lady}. Retract your words, or meet me on the duelling ground.
dlga_lord_denounce_3:lord_denounce_4.1|Is that so? Well, hear this -- you're a snake, and a knave, and -- if you don't meet me on the duelling ground -- a coward. What say you to that? Do you retract your words, or shall we cross swords?
dlga_lord_denounce_4:lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_duel_confirm|It would be a pleasure to fight you.
dlga_lord_denounce_4:lord_denounce_retract|I spoke rashly. I retract my words.
dlga_lord_denounce_retract:lord_pretalk|I thought as much. Now, be gone from here.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_respond_to_insult|{s9}, 
dlga_lord_pretalk:party_encounter_lord_hostile_attacker_2|But enough talking - yield or fight!
dlga_lord_pretalk:lord_talk|Anything else?
dlga_hero_pretalk:lord_talk|Anything else?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_quarrel_intervention_1|I wish to address your quarrel with {s11}, 
dlga_lord_talk:lord_recruit_1_relation|Stay your hand! There is something I must say to you in private.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_bandit_information|I am hunting a group of bandits with the following description... Have you seen them?
dlga_lord_bandit_information:lord_pretalk|{s15}, 
dlga_lord_talk:lord_internal_politics_cur_stance|Who do you think should be made the marshal of our realm?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_internal_politics_cur_stance.1|Whom do you think should receive the fief of {s4}?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_husband_auto_recruit|I need you to renounce your allegiance to {s4} and join the {s5} now, my husband.
dlga_lord_husband_auto_recruit:lord_pretalk|Ask me again when we are outside of these walls, my wife.
dlga_lord_husband_auto_recruit:close_window|As you wish, my wife.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_recruit_1_relation.1|There is a matter which I would like to discuss in private.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_recruit_1_relation.2|There is something which I would like to discuss with to you in private.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_talk|CHEAT -- Reset lord decision seed and intrigue impatience, 
dlga_lord_talk:lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_duel|CHEAT -- Let's duel (insult), 
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult:lord_pretalk|Hah! I admire a quick tongue. Perhaps some day I shall remove it, with tongs, to admire it at greater leisure, but today, at least, I shall salute your wit and courage.
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult:lord_pretalk.1|I meant no offense, madame.
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult:lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_battle|Are you trying to provoke me? Well, I'll would have you know that I am under no obligation to duel women, commoners, rebels, or brigands. I could, however, order my men to seize you and horsewhip you. Would you like them to do that?
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult:lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_duel|Are you trying to provoke me? Well, I'll have you know that I am under no obligation to duel women, commoners, rebels, or brigands. However, in your case, I would be delighted to make an exception. Are you ready for a lesson in deference to your betters, {varlot/girl}?
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult:close_window|Are you trying to provoke me? Well, I'll would have you know that I am under no obligation to duel women, commoners, rebels, or brigands. You are lucky that I am in a good mood, because I am perfectly within my rights to order my men to seize you and horsewhip you. Now begone -- I have had enough of you.
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_battle:lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_battle_confirm|I would like to see them try.
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_battle:close_window|This is not worth the shedding of blood.
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_battle_confirm:close_window|Enough of your insolence! At {him/her}, lads!
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_duel:lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_duel_confirm|I am ready to teach you one.
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_duel:close_window|This is not worth the shedding of blood.
dlga_lord_respond_to_insult_challenge_duel_confirm:close_window|So be it. Defend yourself!
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_1:lord_quarrel_intervention_2|{s14}, 
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_2:lord_quarrel_intervention_3a|Ah, well. It sounds like you're in the right, then.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_2:lord_quarrel_intervention_3b|Whatever your differences, I want you to settle them.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_2:lord_quarrel_intervention_3b.1|Could you not be convinced to settle your differences?
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_2:lord_pretalk|On second thought, I want nothing to do with this.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_3a:lord_pretalk|I'm glad that you think so.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_3b:lord_quarrel_intervention_4|For the sake of our friendship, I defer to your judgment. I will try to make amends with {s11}.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_3b:lord_pretalk|I will not reconcile with {s11}. I know my rights.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_4:lord_pretalk|Let it be as though our quarrel never occurred.
dlga_lord_quarrel_intervention_4:lord_pretalk.1|I suppose that you should speak to {s11}, and see if he will do the same for me.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_cur_stance:lord_internal_politics_cur_stance_plyr_response|I had already made up my mind to support you.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_cur_stance:lord_internal_politics_cur_stance_plyr_response.1|I am unable to decide at this time,

dlga_lord_internal_politics_support_same_acknowledge:lord_pretalk.2|I will tell {s4}. He will no doubt be grateful for your support.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_choose_candidate_select:lord_internal_politics_pretalk.2|I support {s4},

dlga_lord_internal_politics_cur_stance_plyr_response:lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support|Can I convince you to support me instead?
dlga_lord_internal_politics_cur_stance_plyr_response:lord_pretalk|Anyway, enough of politics for the time being.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk|You have engendered too much controversy to be a viable candidate right now. I would advise you to wait a little while before seeking any further honors for yourself.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk.1|I am sorry. I would not wish to strain my relationship with {s4}, 
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk.2|You have already been well-rewarded with fiefs appropriate to your accomplishments, I would say.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk.3|I think you would need to prove yourself further before you are eligible for that position.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk.4|Hmm... That is too much to ask, given the state of our relationship.
dlga_lord_internal_politics_plyr_request_support:lord_pretalk.5|I would support you with pleasure.
dlga_lord_recruit_1_relation:lord_pretalk|I am a bit weary of talking politics. Perhaps at a later date, 
dlga_lord_recruit_1_relation:lord_pretalk.1|{s12}, 
dlga_lord_recruit_1_relation:lord_recruit_pretender|You have raised the standard of rebellion on behalf of {s16}. Have you come to plead {reg3?her:his} case?
dlga_lord_recruit_pretender:lord_recruit_3_dilemma_1|I have,

dlga_lord_recruit_2:lord_recruit_2_philosophy|What do you think, in general terms, about kings, lords, and politics?
dlga_lord_recruit_2:lord_spouse_leave_faction|My husband, I believe that you should rethink you allegiance to {s11}
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction:lord_spouse_leave_faction_2|{s9} has always been a good liege to me, but I will hear you out. What do you suggest we do?
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction:lord_spouse_leave_faction_2.1|I see no particular reason to abandon {s9}, but I will heed your advice. What do you suggest we do?
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction:lord_spouse_leave_faction_2.2|Yes -- as a liege, {s9} is a great disappointment. What do you suggest we do?
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_2:lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king|I believe you should be king, my husband!
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_2:lord_spouse_leave_faction_proclaim_queen|I am the rightful queen of Calradia, 
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_2:lord_pretalk|Never mind, 
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king:lord_pretalk|Perhaps some day, my wife -- but before I declare myself king, I should like for one of us to hold a fortress which could serve as our court before we declare ourselves publically.
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_proclaim_queen:lord_pretalk|While I do not contest your claim, my wife, I should like for one of us to hold a fortress which could serve as our court before we declare ourselves publically.

dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_proclaim_queen:lord_pretalk.1|{s11}, 
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_proclaim_queen_confirm:close_window|I am ready now, my husband. Let us go forth to seek our throne.
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_proclaim_queen_confirm:lord_pretalk|Perhaps I am not yet ready.
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king:lord_pretalk.1|Perhaps, but I would need your full support to press that claim. You would want to resolve {s4}'s rebellion before pushing this any further.
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king:lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king_2|Most of the great families of this land have a claim to the throne... Given the recent issues with the succession, I should be as legitimate a king as {s4}.
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king_2:lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king_3|While king, I will defer to your judgment in the appointment of ministers, the conduct of diplomacy, and other such matters.
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king_3:close_window|Very well, my husband. Let us ride forth to press your claim!
dlga_lord_spouse_leave_faction_husband_king_3:lord_pretalk|Actually, let us bide out time for a bit.
dlga_lord_recruit_2_philosophy:lord_recruit_2|{s43} Did you wish to speak of anything else?
dlga_lord_recruit_2:lord_recruit_2_discontent|How do you feel about {s15}?
dlga_lord_recruit_2:lord_recruit_3_a|Do you remember what I had told you earlier?

dlga_lord_recruit_hesitant:lord_pretalk|Ah. Very good.
dlga_lord_recruit_hesitant_persuade:lord_recruit_3|If you put it that way, I admit that I do sometimes worry about the state of the realm.
dlga_lord_recruit_hesitant_persuade:lord_pretalk|You try my patience. I said that I have nothing to say.
dlga_lord_recruit_3:lord_recruit_3_a|Well, I have something to tell you.

dlga_lord_recruit_3_d:lord_recruit_3_claim.1|If {s45} were {s47}, {s45} would deal with all men fairly and uphold the rights of the commons.

dlga_lord_recruit_3_d:lord_recruit_3_claim.3|Because {s45} can unify Calradia and end this discord.

dlga_lord_recruit_6:lord_recruit_6_reaction|It is time for you to make a decision.
dlga_lord_recruit_6:lord_pretalk|No need to decide anything -- we can speak of this at a later time.

dlga_lord_recruit_7_decision:lord_pretalk|{s12}, 
dlga_lord_recruit_7_decision:lord_recruit_pledge|Very well -- I am ready to pledge myself to {s4} as my {reg4?queen:king}.
dlga_lord_recruit_pledge:lord_recruit_pledge|Remember. You have promised me a fief. I will hold you to that promise.
dlga_lord_recruit_pledge:lord_recruit_pledge_conclude|So be it -- I pledge allegiance to you as your faithful vassal. I shall stand at your side to fight your enemies should you need my sword, and uphold your claims and those of your legitimate heirs. I expect in turn that you will protect me and recognize my rights as your vassal.
dlga_lord_recruit_pledge:lord_recruit_pledge_conclude.1|So be it -- you may inform {s4} that I am now {reg4?her:him} faithful vassal, that I will follow {reg4?her:him} as long as my breath remains, and I will be at {reg4?her:his} side to fight your enemies should you need my sword, and that I uphold your lawful claims and those of your legitimate heirs. In turn, I expect his protection and his recognition of my rights as his vassal.
dlga_lord_recruit_pledge_conclude:close_window|Now... It is a momentous step I have taken. I will take my leave, as I may need some time prepare myself for what comes next.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.3|I received the gift, presented to me through my {s11} {s10}. It was a noble gesture, {sir/my lady}, and I regret that we ever quarreled.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.4|I received the gift, presented to me through my {s11} {s10}. For {reg4?her:his} sake, I am willing to let bygones be bygones.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.5|I received the gift, presented to me through my {s11} {s10}. Bah! Do you think you can buy my friendship?
dlga_lord_start:close_window.6|I received the gift, presented to me through my {s11} {s10}. As dear as {reg?she:he} is to me, however, I cannot forget our differences.
dlga_lord_talk:denounce_lord_results|I did as you suggested, and denounced {s4}
dlga_denounce_lord_results:lord_pretalk|Yes, and hopefully now {s4} will think twice before entrusting him with any additional fiefs, honors, or offices. We are grateful to you.
dlga_denounce_lord_results:close_window|So you did -- and we have heard that he forced you to retract your words, and thus emerged from this affair looking stronger than before. You will forgive me, {sir/my lady}, if my gratitude to you is somewhat muted.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_quest_intrigue_result|I did as you asked, and spoke to {s5} about the danger posed by {s4}.
dlga_lord_quest_intrigue_result:lord_pretalk|So we hear. Hopefully now {s5} will think twice before entrusting him with any additional fiefs, honors, or offices. We are grateful to you.
dlga_lord_quest_intrigue_result:close_window|So we hear -- but alas, {s5} seems not to have listened. Still, we are grateful to you for trying.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_lend_companion_end|I should like {s14} returned to me, {s65}, if you no longer require {reg3?her:his} services.
dlga_lord_lend_companion_end:lord_pretalk|You've too many men in your company already, {playername}. You could not lead any more at the moment.
dlga_lord_lend_companion_end:lord_pretalk.1|Certainly, {playername}. {reg3?She:He} is a bright {reg3?girl:fellow}, you're a lucky {man/woman} to have such worthy companions.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_to_collect_debt|I've come to collect the debt you owe to {s1}.
dlga_lord_ask_to_collect_debt:lord_ask_to_collect_debt_2|Oh. Well, {s1} did lend me some silver a ways back, but I've done him many favours in the past and I consider that money as my due payment.
dlga_lord_ask_to_collect_debt_2:convince_begin|{s1} considers it a debt. He asked me to speak to you on his behalf.
dlga_lord_ask_to_collect_debt_2:lord_pretalk|Then I will not press the matter any further.
dlga_convince_accept:close_window|My debt to {s8} has long been overdue and was a source of great discomfort to me. Thank you for accepting to take the money to him. Please give him these {reg10} denars and thank him on my behalf.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_to_make_peace|Please, {s64}, it's time to end this war between {s12} and {s13}.
dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace:lord_ask_to_make_peace_2|Eh? I'm not sure I heard you right, {playername}. War is not easily forgotten by either side of the conflict, and I have a very long memory. Why should I take any interest in brokering peace with those dogs?
dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace_2:convince_begin|Perhaps I can talk you into it...
dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace_2:lord_pretalk|Never mind, peace can wait for now.
dlga_convince_accept:close_window.1|You... have convinced me, {playername}. Very well then, you've my blessing to bring a peace offer to {s14}. I cannot guarantee they will accept it, but on the off-chance they do, I will stand by it.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_challenge_duel_for_lady|I want you to take back your accusations against {s1}.
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady:lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2|What accusations? Everyone knows that she beds her stable boys and anyone else she can lay hands on while her husband is away. I merely repeat the words of many.
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2:lord_challenge_duel|You will recant these lies, sirrah, or prove them against my sword!
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2:lord_pretalk|If you say so...
dlga_lord_challenge_duel:close_window|{s15}, 
dlga_lord_talk:lord_challenge_courtship_rival|Relinquish your suit of {s5}!
dlga_lord_challenge_courtship_rival:lord_challenge_courtship_rival_2|Or what? Do you intend to duel over a lady? I'll let you know -- our liege frowns on this sort of hot-headed challenge, when every man must stand together against the foreign foe.
dlga_lord_challenge_courtship_rival_2:lord_challenge_duel|Do you fear to fight me?
dlga_lord_challenge_courtship_rival_2:lord_pretalk|My pardon. I have spoken rashly...
dlga_lord_talk:lord_message_delivered|I bring a message from {s9}.
dlga_lord_message_delivered:lord_pretalk|Oh? Let me see that... Well, well, well! It was good of you to bring me this, {playername}. Take my seal as proof that I've received it, and give my regards to {s9} when you see him again.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_message_delivered_enemy|I bring a message from {s9}.
dlga_lord_message_delivered_enemy:close_window|Oh? Let me see that... Hmmm. It was good of you to bring me this, {playername}. Take my seal as proof that I've received it, with my thanks.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_deliver_message_prisoner|I bring a message from {s11}.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2|Can it be true? Oh, thank you kindly, {playername}! You have brought hope and some small ray of light to these bleak walls. Perhaps one day I will be able to repay you.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2a| 'Twas the least I could do, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2a:close_window|You've no idea how grateful I am, {playername}. A thousand thanks and more.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2b|Worry not, {s65}. You'll have ample opportunity once you are free again.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2b:close_window|Hah, of course, {playername}. My eternal thanks go with you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer|Fear not, I am here to rescue you.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_2|By God, are you serious? What is your plan?
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_2:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_3|A simple ruse, {s65}. If we exchange garments, I shall take your place here in prison, while you make your escape disguised as myself. I paid the guards a handsome bribe, with which I am sure they have already purchased half the wine stocks of the nearest tavern. With some luck they'll soon get so drunk they'd have trouble recognising their own mothers, let alone telling one of us from the other. At least not until you are safely away.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_3:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4|Hmm, it might just work... But what of you, my {friend/lady}? The guards won't take kindly to this trickery. You may end up spending some time in this cell yourself.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5a|Not to worry, {s65}. The place is already starting to grow on me.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5b|I shall be fine as long there is an ample reward waiting at the end.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5a:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6|You are a brave soul indeed. I won't forget this.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5b:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6|Of course, my {friend/lady}, of course! Come to me when you have regained your freedom, and perhaps I shall be able to repay the debt I owe you.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6:close_window|Quickly, {s65}, let us change garments. It is past time you were away from here.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced|{s66}, I wish to restore my old oath to {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced:lord_pretalk|That is too great a matter for me to decide, {playername}. You should seek out {s4}. Such clemency is his alone to grant or deny.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced:lord_ask_pardon_terms|{s11}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk|As you like, {s65}. I will accept your judgment.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk.1|A shame, {s65}. A shame.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk.2|Very well, go and die without me.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace|Aye, I am ready.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected|On second thought, no. I don't wish to be in your service again.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace.1|Aye, I agree to those terms.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected.1|That is too high a price, {s65}. I must decline.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace:lord_pretalk|Excellent. Though you strayed from us, {playername}, it gladdens all our hearts that you have found your way back to the right path. I hereby restore your homage to me. Rise once more as an honoured {man/warrior} in my service.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected:close_window|Then get out of my sight, traitor! Begone with you, and do not come back!
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_pardon|I wish to make peace with the {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk|Do you indeed, {playername}? Then go and trip on your sword. Give us all peace.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.1|{playername}, you are a {lord/lady} without a master, holding lands in your name, with only the barest scrap of a claim to legitimacy. No king in Calradia would accept a lasting peace with you.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.2|Make peace when I have you at an advantage? I think not.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.3|I do not see it as being in my current interest to make peace.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_truce_offer|Yes... I am weary of fighting you. I could offer you a truce of forty days. If you keep your word and do not molest my lands and subjects, we may talk again...
dlga_lord_truce_offer:close_window|I accept. Let us stop making war upon each other, for the time being anyway
dlga_lord_truce_offer:lord_pretalk|On second thought, such an accord would not be in my interests.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2|Hmm. I could use my considerable influence to arrange a pardon for you, {playername}, but there are some who see you as an enemy and will not be satisfied unless you pay tribute. All in all, you'd need to bring no less than {reg16} denars to make any friends in {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.4|I am in no position to offer you anything. You must speak to {s7}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2.1|Yes... I have bigger worries than you or your followers. However, you have wronged my subjects, and wrongs demand compensation. For the sume of {reg16} denars, I suppose that I could agree to grant you a pardon. What do you say?
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.5|I am sorry. I am in no position to offer you a pardon, 
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept|I have the money here. {reg16} denars.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny|I fear I cannot pay that much.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window|Excellent, {playername}. I will use this to make amends to those you have wronged, and I will let it be known that you are no longer an enemy of the {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window.1|Excellent, {playername}. I'll use the coin to smooth the feathers of those that can oppose your pardon, and I'm sure that word will soon spread that you are no longer an enemy of {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny:lord_pretalk|Then there's nothing I can do for you, {playername}. No silver, no pardon.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_active_mission_1|About the task you gave me...
dlga_lord_talk:lord_switch_to_spouse|Let us discuss matters related to our household.
dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:lord_pretalk|Let us wait until we are in a hall, my wife, as it is difficult to deal with household inventories and such matters in the field.
dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:spouse_talk|Certainly, my wife
dlga_lord_talk:lord_request_mission_ask|Do you have any tasks for me?
dlga_lord_talk:combined_political_quests|Do you think we can work together to advance our standings in this realm?
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk|I do not imagine that you and I have many mutual interests.
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk.1|Hmm.. Perhaps we can discuss this matter in a more private setting, at a later date.
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk.2|Hmm.. I do have an idea, but it would require you that you be free of controversy. If you were to wait some time without getting into any arguments with the other lords of our realm, perhaps we could proceed further.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_resign_marshalship|I wish to resign the marshalship, 
dlga_lord_ask_resign_marshalship:lord_pretalk|So be it. I shall have to find someone else.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service|{s66}, I have come to offer you my sword in vassalage!
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service.1|{s66}, I wish to become your sworn {man/woman} and fight for your honour.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_leave_service|{s66}, I wish to be released from my oath to you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_talk_preoffer|I have an offer for you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_troops|I want to give some troops to you.
dlga_lord_give_troops:lord_pretalk|Well, I could use some good soldiers. Thank you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_order_ask|I have a new task for you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_suggestion_ask|May I suggest a course of action?
dlga_lord_give_order_ask:lord_give_order|Yes?
dlga_lord_give_suggestion_ask:lord_give_order|I will gladly follow your direction, {sire/your Highness}. If you intend to direct an extensive campaign, however, you may also wish to declare yourself marshal, so there is no cause for confusion.
dlga_lord_give_suggestion_ask:lord_pretalk|My apologies. I don't know you well enough to take your advice.
dlga_lord_give_suggestion_ask:lord_give_order.1|What is it?
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_answer|Follow me.
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_answer.1|Will you follow me? I have a plan...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask|Go to...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.1|Raid around the village of...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.2|Patrol around...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_assault|Together, you and I can take {s11}. You should assault immediately...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.3|We are under attack, but the enemy can be repulsed. You should ride towards...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.4|We are under attack, but the enemy can be repulsed. You should assemble the army and march to...
dlga_lord_give_order_assault:lord_pretalk|{s4} is directing this siege. I suggest you speak to {reg4?her:him}, 
dlga_lord_give_order_assault:lord_pretalk.1|Our preparations are not yet ready. We need another {s11}, 
dlga_lord_give_order_assault:close_window|Very well -- to the walls!
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.5|There is a fortress which can easily be taken. Go to..
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_details_ask.6|The enemy is coming in force. Flee in the direction of...
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_stop|I won't need you for some time. You are free to do as you like.
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_give_order_stop.1|You no longer need to accompany me.
dlga_lord_give_order:lord_pretalk|Never mind.

dlga_lord_marriage_permission_endowment:lord_marriage_permission_endowment_answer|I would say that, taking into consideration the prestige of our two houses, that you can provide a dower of {reg3} denars, while I will supply a dowry of {reg4} denars.

dlga_lord_give_oath_go_on_3:lord_give_conclude|You have done a wise thing, {playername}. Serve me well and I promise, you will rise high.

dlga_lord_give_conclude_2:close_window.1|So be it, my wife. May all my vassals be as valiant and loyal as you.
dlga_lord_give_conclude_2:close_window.2|I have great hopes for you {playername}. I know you shall prove yourself worthy of the trust I have placed in you.
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service:lord_enter_service_swear|Heh, a wise move, {playername}. With loyal service, a {man/woman} in my service could become wealthy and powerful, and our enemies... Well, our enemies are as wheat before a scythe. However, to enter my service you must first renounce all worldly oaths and bonds, and swear to serve only the {s5}.
dlga_lord_enter_service_swear:lord_enter_service_swear_accepted|I do so swear, {s65}.
dlga_lord_enter_service_swear:lord_enter_service_swear_denied|I need some time to think about this.

dlga_lord_enter_service_swear_accepted_2:close_window|I charge you with rooting out and destroying the forces of our enemies wherever you may find them. Moreover, I will have special tasks for you from time to time, as may some of my other vassal lords. Serve, fight, and honour your oaths. These things will take you far, if you've a mind for promotion. May God grant us long lives and many victories to toast in my hall!
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service:lord_ask_leave_service_verify|Hrm. Has your oath become burdensome, {playername}? It is unusual to request release from homage, but in respect of your fine service, I will not hold you if you truly wish to end it. Though you would be sorely missed.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service:lord_ask_leave_service_verify.1|Release from homage? Hmm, perhaps it would be for the best... However, {playername}, you must be sure that release is what you desire. This is not a thing done lightly.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify:lord_ask_leave_service_2|It is something I must do, {s65}.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify:lord_ask_leave_service_giveup|You are right, {s65}. My place is here.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_giveup:lord_pretalk|I am pleased to hear it, {playername}. I hope you'll banish such unworthy thoughts from your mind from now on.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_2:lord_ask_leave_service_verify_again|Then you are sure? Also, be aware that if you leave my services, you will be surrendering to me all the fiefs which you hold in my name.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify_again:lord_ask_leave_service_3|Yes, {s65}.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify_again:lord_ask_leave_service_giveup|Of course not, {s65}. I am ever your loyal vassal.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_3:lord_ask_leave_service_end|As you wish. I hereby declare your oaths to be null and void. You will no longer hold land or titles in my name, and you are released from your duties to my house. You are free, {playername}.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_end:lord_ask_leave_service_end_2|Thank you, sir. It was an honour to serve you..
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_end:lord_ask_leave_service_end_2.1|My thanks. It feels good to be {a free man/free} once again.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_end_2:close_window|Farewell then, {playername}, and good luck go with you.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_lend_companion_end|Oh, you want your companion back? I see...
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_pretalk|{playername}, I must beg your patience, I still have need of your companion. Please return later when things have settled.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_active_mission_2|Yes, have you made any progress on it?
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank|Indeed. I brought you {reg1} {s1} as prisoners.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:capture_enemy_hero_thank|Oh, indeed. I've captured a lord from {s13} for you.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank:capture_enemy_hero_thank_2|Many thanks, my friend. He will serve very well for a bargain. You've done a fine work here. Please accept these {reg5} denars for your help.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk|Certainly, {s65}.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk.1|It was nothing.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk.2|Give me more of a challenge next time.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_raise_troops_thank|Indeed. I have raised {reg1} {s13}. You can take them.
dlga_lord_raise_troops_thank:lord_raise_troops_thank_2|These men may well turn the tide in my plans, {playername}. I am confident you've trained them well. My thanks and my compliments to you.
dlga_lord_raise_troops_thank_2:lord_pretalk|Well, the lads are at your command now, sir. I am sure you will take good care of them.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_success|Here are all the taxes from {s3}. It comes up to {reg19} denars.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_half_success|Here are the taxes from {s3}. It comes up to {reg19} denars.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_fail|Unfortunately, a revolt broke up while I was collecting the taxes. I could only collect {reg19} denars.
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_success:lord_pretalk|Well done, {playername}, very well done indeed! You were truly the right {man/person} for the job. I promised you a fifth of the taxes, so that amounts to {reg21} denars. If you give me {reg20} denars, you may keep the difference. A good result for everyone, eh?
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_half_success:lord_pretalk|What?! Is this some scheme of yours, {playername}? That's less than half the taxes I'm owed! You have let them get away with murder as well as my money. What a farce! You can forget the money I promised you, I'm taking {reg20} denars from what you collected, and you're lucky I'm leaving you a few coins for honour's sake.
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_fail:lord_pretalk|God, what a bloody mess you've gotten us into, {playername}.This could turn very ugly if I do not take immediate action.I certainly hope you're not here expecting to be paid for failure.Hand over my {reg19} denars, if you please, and end our business together.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success|I found {s4} hiding at {s3} and gave him his punishment.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_fail|I'm afraid he got away.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2|And we'll all be a lot better off without him! Thank you, {playername}, for removing this long-festering thorn from my side. 'Tis good to know you can be trusted to handle things with an appropriate level of tactfulness. A bounty I promised, and a bounty you shall have. 300 denars and not a copper less!
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept|Let me take the money, {s65}. Thank you.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject|This is blood money. I can't accept it.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept:lord_pretalk|Of course, {playername}. Here you are. Once again, you've my thanks for ridding me of that {s43}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject:lord_pretalk|You are a {man/woman} for whom justice is its own reward, eh? As you wish it, {playername}, as you wish it. An honourable sentiment, to be true. Regardless, you've my thanks for ridding me of that {s43}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_fail:lord_pretalk|It is a sad day when that {s43} manages to avoid the hand of justice yet again. I thought you would be able to do this, {playername}. Clearly I was wrong.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_active_mission_3|I am still working on it.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this quest.
dlga_lord_active_mission_3:lord_pretalk|Good. Remember, I am counting on you.
dlga_lord_mission_failed:lord_pretalk|{s43}, 
dlga_lord_suggets_attack_enemy_castle3:lord_pretalk|That should be possible. Very well, we'll attack {s1}.
dlga_lord_propose_mercenary:lord_mercenary_service|As it happens, {playername}, I promised {s10} that I would hire a company of mercenaries for an upcoming campaign.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_service_reject|I'm not interested, thank you.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_service_accept|Aye, I'll join {s9}.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_elaborate_pay|I'm interested. Please tell me more.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_accept:lord_mercenary_service_verify|Perfect. Of course you shall have to make a formal declaration of allegiance, and give your oath that you and your company will remain in service to {s9} for a period of no less than one month.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify:lord_mercenary_service_verify_2|As you wish. Your enemies are my enemies.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify:lord_mercenary_service_reject|On second thought, forget it.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify_2:lord_mercenary_service_accept_3|That will do. You've made a wise choice, my friend. {s9} does well by its loyal fighters, you will receive many rewards for your service.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_accept_3:lord_pretalk|Now, I suggest you prepare for a serious campaign. Train and equip your soldiers as best you can in the meantime, and respond quickly when you are summoned for duty.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_reject:lord_pretalk|I'm very sorry to hear that. You'll find no better place than {s9}, be sure of that.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_pay:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|I can offer you a contract for one month. At the end of this period, it can be extended on a monthly basis. An initial sum of {reg12} denars will be paid to you to seal the contract. After that, you'll receive wages from {s10} each week, according to the number and quality of the soldiers in your company. You still have your rights to battlefield loot and salvage, as well as any prisoners you capture. War can be very profitable at times...
dlga_lord_mercenary_service_elaborate_duty:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Duties... There are only a few, none of them difficult. The very first thing is to declare your allegiance. An oath of loyalty to our cause. Once that's done, you shall be required to fulfill certain responsibilities. You'll participate in military campaigns, fulfill any duties given to you by your commanders, and most of all you shall attack the enemies of our kingdom wherever you might find them.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_elaborate_duty|And what about my duties as a mercenary?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle|Can I hold on to any castles I take?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_elaborate_banner|Can I fly my own banner?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_elaborate_pay|How much will you pay me for my service?
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_accept|Sounds good. I wish to enter your service as a mercenary.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_1:lord_mercenary_service_reject|Apologies, my sword is not for hire.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Only my loyal vassals can own lands and castles in my realm -- and all my vassals are men.\I am not inclined to depart from this tradition without a very good reason. If you prove yourself in battle, you can swear an oath of homage to me and become my vassal.\We may then discuss how you may obtain a castle.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.1|Hmm... Only loyal vassals of {s10} can own lands and castles. While kings will sometimes accept vassalage from men who prove themselves in battle, and grant them land, I have never heard of a king who gave fiefs to women. You had best discuss that issue with {s10} himself.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.2|Only my loyal vassals can own lands and castles in my realm. A mercenary can not be trusted with such a responsibility. However, after serving for some time, you can swear homage to me and become my vassal. Then you will be rewarded with a fief.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.3|Only loyal vassals of {s10} can own lands and castles. You understand, a simple mercenary cannot be trusted with such responsibility. However, after serving for some time, you may earn the right to swear homage to {s10} and become his vassal. Then you would be rewarded with a fief.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_banner:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Only my noble vassals have the honour of carrying their own banners. However, after some time in mercenary service, you may earn the opportunity to swear homage to me and become my vassal, gaining the right to choose a banner of your own and fight under it in battle.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_banner:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.1|Only noble vassals of {s10} have the honour of carrying their own banners. However, after some time of mercenary service, perhaps you can earn the opportunity to swear homage to {s10} and become his vassal, gaining the right to choose a banner of your own and fight under it in battle.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk|You still haven't finished the last job I gave you, {playername}. You should be working on that, not asking me for other things to do.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk.1|I don't have any other jobs for you right now.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_tell_mission|A task?
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk.2|My lady, by the traditions of courtship, I should be offering my services to you. Unfortunately, I have little time right now, so I beg you to take this declaration of my esteem in its place.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal|There are some minor errands which I need completed, but it would be more appropriate to give them to one of my own men, not to a sworn vassal of the realm.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal:lord_pretalk|If you are looking for action against our foes, you may join our attack on {s4}. The enemy may come in force to oppose us, so it is good to have as many men as possible.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal:lord_pretalk.1|If you are looking for action against our foes, you may try venturing out to {s4}. We have received word that a force of the {s5} is in the area, and I am going there myself. I cannot guarantee you that our enemies will be there when you arrive, of course.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal:lord_pretalk.2|If you are looking for action against our foes, you may try venturing out to {s4}. We have received word that a force of the {s5} is in the area. I am not currently headed that way, but others may be.  I cannot guarantee you that our enemies will be there when you arrive, of course.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_sworn_vassal:lord_pretalk.3|If a worthy task presents itself, however, I may have a favor to ask of you at a later date.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:destroy_lair_quest_brief|Yes -- there is something you can do for us. We have heard reports that a group of {s4} have established a hideout in this area, and have been attacking travellers. If you could find their lair and destroy it, we would be very grateful.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner|My {s11}, {s13}, has been taken prisoner by {s14} of the {s15}. Normally, honorable nobles will grant prisoners of gentle blood the privilege of parole, and treat them as honored guests so long as they give their word that they will not attempt to escape, until such time as a ransom can be paid.  But {s14}, instead of granting {s13} parole, has consigned my {s11} to his dungeons -- no doubt in the hope that he can demand more from us.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm|We need you to get my {s11} out of prison. You may be able to pay a ransom -- in which case we could cover your expenses, up to 5000 denars. If you have connections within {s24}, you may be able to use them to sneak him out. Or, you may try a more direct approach -- walk up to the gaoler, take the keys by force, and then fight your way out. Can you do this for us?
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_accepted|I can try.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_rejected|I don't think that I can help you.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_rejected:close_window|It would not have been an easy task. Perhaps we will find another way.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_accepted:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method|We are most grateful. Could I ask you how you were planning to proceed?
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method|Did you have any other ideas which you wished to discuss?
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak|I am thinking of breaking into the prison in {s24}, finding {s13}, and fighting my way out.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_siege|I am thinking of taking {s24} by storm.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_planning_end|I have done enough planning. Time to act!
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_planning_end:close_window|May the heavens protect you.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2|I had discussed this idea with some of my men. One could enter {s24}, either in disguise or openly, then walk up to the prison guard and try to take the keys by force. However, getting out may be difficult. The garrison may be slow to react, but even so, you are likely to find yourself fighting a half dozen or more of the enemy at once, with limited space in which to maneuver. If you can fight your way past them, though, you can probably get out, 
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2:lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas|You may find it useful to create a distraction, to divert the attention of some of the garrison. If you have any connections in the villages near {s24}, this may be a time to put them to use.
dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_siege:lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas|Well, that is certainly the most direct approach.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message|I need to send a letter to {s13} who should be currently at {s4}. If you will be heading towards there, would you deliver it to him? The letter needs to be in his hands in 30 days.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Certainly, I intend to pass by {s4} and it would be no trouble.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected|I doubt I'll be seeing {s13} anytime soon, {s65}. You'd best send it with someone else.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely|I am no errand boy, sir. Hire a courier for your trivialities.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted:close_window|I appreciate it, {playername}. Here's the letter, and a small sum to cover your travel expenses. Give my regards to {s13} when you see him.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah, all right then. Well, I am sure I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2|Hm, is this how you respond to a polite request for a small favor? A poor show, {playername}. I didn't know you would take offence.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2:lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_3|Then you shall know better from now on.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_2:lord_mission_deliver_message_accepted|Forgive my temper, {s65}. I'll deliver your letter.
dlga_lord_mission_deliver_message_rejected_rudely_3:close_window|All right. I will remember that.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deliver_message.1|I need to deliver a letter to {s13} of {s15}, who must be at {s4} currently. If you are going towards there, would you deliver my letter to him? The letter needs to reach him in 40 days.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|There is a small thing... My {s17} {s13} is due for a visit to her relatives at {s14}. The visit has been postponed several times already with all the trouble on the roads, but this time she is adamant about going. So, I want to at least make sure she's well-guarded. I trust you well, {playername} so I would be very grateful if you could escort her to {s14} and make sure she arrives safe and sound.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_told|A group of bandits have taken refuge in my village of {s15}. They are plundering nearby farms, and getting rich and fat stealing my taxes and feasting on my cattle.I'd like nothing better than to go out there and teach them a lesson, but I have my hands full at the moment, so I can't do anything about it.
dlga_lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_told:lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_accepted|Worry not, I can go to {s15} and deal with these scum for you.
dlga_lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_told:lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_rejected|You shall have to find help elsewhere, I am too busy.
dlga_lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_accepted:close_window|Will you do that? Know that, I will be grateful to you. Here is some money for the expenses of your campaign. Make an example of those {s43}s.
dlga_lord_mission_deal_with_bandits_rejected:lord_pretalk|Ah... Very well then, forget I brought it up.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_raise_troops|No lord should have to admit this, {playername}, but I was inspecting my soldiers the other day and there are men here who don't know which end of a sword to hold. {s43} You are a warrior of renown, {playername}. Will you train some troops for me? I would be grateful to you.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_raise_troops:lord_tell_mission_raise_troops_2|How many men do you need?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_raise_troops_2:lord_mission_raise_troops_told|If you can raise {reg1} {s14} and bring them to me, that will probably be enough.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted|Of course, {s65}. Give me {reg1} fresh recruits and I'll train them to be {s14}.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_told:lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected|I am too busy these days to train anyone.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_accepted:close_window|You've taken a weight off my shoulders, {playername}. I shall tell my sergeants to send you the recruits and attach them to your command. Also, I'll advance you some money to help with expenses. Here, this purse should do it. Thank you for your help.
dlga_lord_mission_raise_troops_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, of course. I had expected as much. Well, good luck to you then.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_collect_taxes_told|You probably know that I am the lord of the {reg9?town:village} of {s3}. However, it has been months since {s3} has delivered the taxes and rents due me as its rightful lord. Apparently the populace there has grown unruly lately and I need someone to go there and remind them of their obligations. And to . . . persuade them if they won't listen. If you go there and raise the taxes they owe me, I will grant you one-fifth of everything you collect.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_told:lord_mission_collect_taxes_accepted|A fair offer, {s65}. We have an agreement.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_told:lord_mission_collect_taxes_rejected|Forgive me, I don't have the time.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_accepted:close_window|Welcome news, {playername}. I will entrust this matter to you. Remember, those {reg9?townsmen:peasants} are foxy beasts, they will make every excuse not to pay me my rightful incomes. Do not let them fool you.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, yes. Well, good luck to you then.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  He murdered one of my men and has been on the run from his judgment ever since. I can't let him get away with avoiding justice, so I've put a bounty of 300 denars on his head. Friends of the murdered man reckon that this assassin may have taken refuge with his kinsmen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt him down and give him what he deserves, and claim the bounty for yourself.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|Then I will hunt him down and execute the law.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected|I am too busy to go after him at the moment.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}. I will be grateful to you and so will the family of the man he murdered. And of course the bounty on his head will be yours if you can get him. Well, good hunting to you.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done . . .
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant|The wretched truth is that I owe a considerable sum of money to one of the merchants here in {s3}. I've no intention of paying it back, of course, but that loud-mouthed fool is making a terrible fuss about it. He even had the audacity to come and threaten me -- me! -- with a letter of complaint to the trade guilds and bankers. Why, he'd ruin my good reputation! So I need a {man/woman} I can trust, someone who will guarantee the man's silence. For good.
dlga_lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant:lord_mission_accepted_kill_local_merchant|Worry not, he shan't breathe a word.

dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town|I have a sensitive matter which needs tending to, {playername}, and no trustworthy retainers to take care of it. The fact is that I have a spy in {s13} to keep an eye on things for me, and report anything that might warrant my attention.

dlga_lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted|I don't mind a bit of skullduggery. Count me in.
dlga_lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_rejected|I must decline. This cloak-and-dagger work isn't fit for me.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Excellent! Make your way to {s13} as soon as you can, the spy will be waiting.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_2|{s13} is heavily defended. How can I get close without being noticed?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_2:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|You shall have to use stealth. Take care to avoid enemy strongholds, villages and patrols, and don't bring too many men with you. If you fail to sneak in the first time, give it a while for the garrison to lower its guard again, or you may have a difficult time infiltrating the town.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_3|How will I recognise the spy?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_3:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Once you get to {s13} you must talk to the locals, the spy will be one of them. If you think you've found the spy, say the phrase '{s11}' The spy will respond with the phrase '{s12}' Thus you will know the other, and {reg7?she:he} will give you any information {reg7?she:he}'s gathered in my service.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_4|Will I be paid?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_4:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Of course, I have plenty of silver in my coffers for loyal {men/women} like you. Do well by me, {playername}, and you'll rise high.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_end|I know what to do. Farewell, my lord.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_end:lord_pretalk|Good luck, {playername}. Remember, the secret phrase is '{s11}' The counterphrase is '{s12}' Bring any reports back to me, and I'll compensate you for your trouble.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}, but I strongly advise you to forget anything I told you about any spies. They do not exist, have never existed, and no one will ever find them. Remember that.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war|This peace with {s13} ill suits me, {playername}. We've let those swine have their way for far too long. Now they get stronger with each passing and their arrogance knows no bounds. I say, we must wage war on them before it's too late! Unfortunately, some of the bleeding hearts among our realm's lords are blocking a possible declaration of war. Witless cowards with no stomach for blood.
dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2|You are right, {s65}, but what can we do?
dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1|I disagree, sir. It is better that there be peace.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3|Ah, tis good to hear someone who understands! As a matter of fact, there is something we can do, {playername}. A little bit of provocation... If one of our war parties managed to enter their territory and pillage one of their caravans, or raided one of their villages, and perhaps left behind a little token or two of the {s14}, they would have ample cause to declare war on us. And then, well, even the cowards among us must rise to defend themselves. So what do you say? Are you interested?
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|An excellent plan. Count me in.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4|Why don't you do that yourself?
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5|Well, {playername}, some of the lords in our kingdom won't like the idea of someone inciting a war without their consent. They are already looking for an excuse to get at me, and if I did this they could make me pay for it dearly. You, on the other hand, are young and well-liked and daring, so you might just get away with it. And of course I will back you up and defend your actions against your opponents. All in all, a few lords might be upset at your endeavour, but I am sure you won't be bothered with that, 
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|That seems reasonable. I am willing to do this.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2|I don't like this. Find yourself someone else to take the blame for your schemes.
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted:close_window|Very good! A raid on a caravan, or, if you can't manage that, an attack on one of their villages, should do the trick. Now, good luck and good hunting. Go set the borders aflame!
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1:lord_pretalk|Ah, you think so? But how long will your precious peace last? Not long, believe me.
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2:lord_pretalk|Hm. As you wish, {playername}. I thought you had some fire in you, but it seems I was wrong.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|Well, some of the serfs working my fields in {s4} have run away. The ungrateful swine, I let them plough my fields and rent my cottages, and this is how they repay me! From what I've been hearing, they're running to {s3} as fast as they can, and have split up into three groups to try and avoid capture. I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary. I should really have them hanged for attempting to escape, but we need hands for the upcoming harvest, so I'll let them go off this time with a good beating.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy|I have good information that a man in this very town is actually an enemy spy. He should be seized and hanged for his impudence, but we also believe that very soon he will leave town to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers. The spy himself is of little import, but the master is a dangerous man, and could tell us a great deal if we could only get our hands on him...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves town. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place. You must take absolute care not to be seen by the spy on your way, else he may suspect foul play and turn back. When the master appears, you must ambush and arrest them and bring the pair back to me. Alive, if you please.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted|I'll do it, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected|No, this skulking is not for me.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted:close_window|Good, I'm sure you'll do a fine job of it. One of my men will point the spy out to you when he leaves, so you will know the man to follow. Remember, I want them both, and I want them alive.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected:lord_pretalk|A shame. Well, carry on as you were, {playername}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero|There is a difficult job I need done, {playername}, and you may be the {man/one} who can carry it off. I need someone to capture one of the noble lords of {s13} and bring him to me. Afterwards, I'll be able to exchange him in return for a relative of mine held by {s13}. It is a simple enough job, but whomever you choose will be guarded by an elite band of personal retainers. Are you up for a fight?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted|Consider it done, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected|I must refuse, {s65}. I am not a kidnapper.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted:close_window|I like your spirit! Go and bring me one of our enemies, and I'll toast your name in my hall when you return! And reward you for your efforts, of course...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected:lord_pretalk|Clearly you lack the mettle I had thought you possessed. Very well, {playername}, I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion|I don't have a job for you right now, but your companion {s3} is a skilled {reg3?lass:fellow} and I need someone with {reg3?her:his} talents. Will you lend {reg3?her:him} to me for a while?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_2|How long will you be needing {reg3?her:him}?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_2:lord_mission_lend_companion_told|Just a few days, a week at most.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted|Then I will leave {s3} with you for one week.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected|I am sorry, but I cannot do without {s3} for a whole week.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted:close_window|I cannot thank you enough, {playername}. Worry not, your companion shall be returned to you with due haste.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected:lord_pretalk|Well, that's damned unfortunate, but I suppose I cannot force you or {s3} to agree. I shall have to make do without.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt|Some time ago, I loaned out a considerable sum of money to {s3}. {reg4} denars, to be precise. He was supposed to pay it back within a month but I haven't received a copper from him since. That was months ago. If you could collect the debt from him on my behalf, I would be grateful indeed. I would even let you keep one fifth of the money for your trouble. What do you say?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_2|Do you know where I can find {s3}, {s65}?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_2:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3|If you leave now, you should be able to find him at {s4}. I've no doubt that he will be suitably embarassed by his conduct and give you all the money he owes me.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_accepted|Then I will talk to {s3} on your behalf.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_rejected|Forgive me, {s65}, but I doubt I would be more successful than yourself.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_accepted:close_window|You made me very happy by accepting this {playername}. Please, talk to {s3} and don't leave him without my money.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_rejected:lord_pretalk|Perhaps not, {playername}. I suppose I'm never getting that money back...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander|I tell you, that blubbering fool {s13} is not fit to rule {s14}. God knows he would be divested of his lands in an instant were it not for one of his loyal vassals, {s15}. As long as he has his vassal aiding him, it will be a difficult job beating him. So I need to get {s15} out of the picture, and I have a plan just to do that... With your help, naturally.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2|{s66}, I am all ears.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|I don't wish to involve myself in anything dishonourable against {s15}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected:lord_pretalk|Dishonourable? Bah! I was hoping I could count on you, {playername}, but you've shown me what a fool I was. I shall have to find someone whose loyalty I can trust.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3|I have written a fake letter to {s15}, bearing my own seal, which implicates him in a conspiracy with us to stage a coup in {s14}, in my favour. If we can make {s13} believe the letter is genuine, he will deal with {s15} very swiftly. Of course, the challenge there is to convince {s13} that the letter is indeed real...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_4|Please continue, {s65}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I will not sully myself with this dishonourable scheme.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_4:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5|This is where you come into play. You'll take the letter to {s14}, then give it to one of your soldiers and instruct him to take it to {s15}. I will have one of my spies inform the town garrison so that your man will be arrested on his way. The guards will then find the letter and take it to {s13}. They'll torture your man, of course, to try and get the truth out of him, but all he knows is that you ordered the letter to be delivered to {s15} under the utmost secrecy. {s13} knows you serve me, and the fool will certainly believe the whole charade.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7|Is that all?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8|There is one more thing... Your messenger must be someone trustworthy. If you sent the letter with a simple peasant, someone expendable, {s13} might suspect a plot. He may have the wits of a snail, but even a snail can see the obvious. Give the letter to someone of rank. One of your {s9}, perhaps.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9|What? I can't send one of my trusted {s9} to his death!
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|Then a {s8} it will be.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10|Come now, {playername}. There is a place for sentimentality, but this is not it. Believe me, you shall be generously compensated, and what is the purpose of soldiers if not to die at our say-so?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|A {s8} it is.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I'll not sacrifice one of my chosen men.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin:lord_pretalk|I can't tell you how pleased I am to hear that, {playername}. You are removing one of the greatest obstacles in my path. Here is the letter, as well as 300 denars for your expenses. Remember, there'll be more once you succeed. Much, much more...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.2|A group of my soldiers were captured in a recent skirmish with the enemy. Thankfully we have a mutual agreement of prisoner exchange, and they will release my men, but they want us to give them prisoners of equal rank and number. Prisoners I don't currently have. So, I need a good {man/warrior} to find me {reg1} {s3} as prisoners, that I may exchange them.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_pretalk|No {playername}. I do not need your help at this time.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_accepted|You can count on me, {s65}.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_rejected|I fear I cannot accept such a mission at the moment.
dlga_lord_mission_accepted:close_window|Excellent, {playername}, excellent. I have every confidence in you.
dlga_lord_mission_rejected:close_window|Is that so? Well, I suppose you're just not up to the task. I shall have to look for somebody with more mettle.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_leave_prison|I must leave now.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_leave|This audience is over. I leave now.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_leave.1|I must beg my leave.
dlga_lord_leave:lord_leave_give_quest|Before you go, {playername}, I have something to ask of you... We may be enemies in this war, but I pray that you believe, as I do, that we can still be civil towards each other. Thus I hoped that you would be kind enough to assist me in something important to me.
dlga_lord_leave_give_quest:enemy_lord_tell_mission|I am listening.
dlga_enemy_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|I have a friend here, an old warrior, who is very sick. Pestilence has infected an old battle wound, and unless he is seen to by a surgeon soon, he will surely die. This man is dear to me, {playername}, but he's also stubborn as a hog and refuses to have anyone look at his injury because he doesn't trust the physicians here. I have heard that you've a capable surgeon with you. If you would let your surgeon come here and have a look, {reg3?she:he} may be able to convince him to give his consent to an operation. Please, I will be deeply indebted to you if you grant me this request, 
dlga_lord_leave_prison:close_window|We'll meet again.
dlga_lord_leave:close_window|Farewell, my lady. I shall remain your most ardent admirer.
dlga_lord_leave:close_window.1|Of course, {playername}. Farewell.

dlga_lord_leave:close_window.3|Yes, yes. Farewell.
dlga_lord_leave:close_window.4|We will meet again.
dlga_member_chat:lady_journey_1|Are you enjoying the journey, {s65}?
dlga_lady_journey_1:close_window|I am doing quite fine, {playername}. Thank you for your concern.
dlga_start:spouse_talk|Yes, my husband?
dlga_spouse_talk:minister_issues|As you are my chief minister, I wish to speak to about affairs of state
dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_cancel_political_quest|Let's abandon our plan to {s10}.
dlga_spouse_cancel_political_quest:spouse_cancel_political_quest_confirm|Are you sure you want to drop that idea?
dlga_spouse_cancel_political_quest_confirm:spouse_pretalk|Yes, I am sure. Let's abandon that idea.
dlga_spouse_cancel_political_quest_confirm:spouse_pretalk.1|Actually, never mind.
dlga_spouse_talk:combined_political_quests|Let us think of a way to improve our standing in this realm, 
dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_organize_feast|I was thinking that perhaps we could host a feast, 
dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_household_possessions|Let us take inventory of our household possessions, 
dlga_spouse_household_possessions:spouse_pretalk|Anyway, that is the content of our larder.
dlga_spouse_talk:close_window|We shall speak later, my {wife/husband}
dlga_wedding_ceremony_bride_vow:wedding_ceremony_player_vow|My husband, I hearby pledge to be your wife, to stand with you in good times and bad. May the heavens smile upon us and bless us with children, livestock, and land.
dlga_wedding_ceremony_player_vow:wedding_ceremony_vows_complete|I pledge the same. Let us be husband and wife.
dlga_wedding_ceremony_player_vow:close_window|Wait -- hold on... I'm not quite ready for this.
dlga_wedding_ceremony_vows_complete:close_window|I now declare you and {s3} to be husband and wife. Go now to the chamber prepared for you, and we shall make arrangements for your bride to join you in your hall in {s11}.
dlga_spouse_pretalk:spouse_talk|Is there anything else, my {husband/wife}?
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, let us wait for the current feast here to conclude, before organizing another.
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk.1|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, we must establish a court before hosting a feast.
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk.2|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, our realm has recently had a feast. Perhaps we should wait another {reg3} days before we organize another one.
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_evaluate_larder_for_feast|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, to not insult our guests, we must make sure that we can provide a large and varied repast, for the lords, their families, and their retinues. All told, we should count on a couple of hundred mouths to feed, over several days. Let us take an inventory of our household possessions..
dlga_spouse_evaluate_larder_for_feast:spouse_feast_confirm|{s9}, 
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm:spouse_feast_added_items|Let me add more items to our storehouses, 
dlga_spouse_feast_added_items:spouse_evaluate_larder_for_feast|All right -- let me reevalute what is there...
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm:spouse_feast_confirm_yes|Let us dispatch the invitations, 
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm:spouse_pretalk|Let us wait, then
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm_yes:spouse_pretalk|I shall send word, then, that we will host a feast as soon as conditions in the realm permit. You perhaps should continue to stock our larder, so that we may do justice to our reputation for hospitality.
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm_yes:spouse_pretalk.1|Very well, then. Let the feast begin immediately at our court {reg4?here:} in {s9}. You perhaps should continue to stock our larder, so that we may do justice to our reputation for hospitality. You may declare the feast to be concluded at any time, either by beginning a campaign or by letting it be known that the vassals can return to their homes.
dlga_start:close_window.76|How wonderful it is... In a short while we shall be married! However, I should point out that, in the remaining few days, it is not customary for us to speak too much together.
dlga_start:close_window.77|Em, {playername}, you might not be used to our wedding customs, but I had hoped that someone would tell you... Speak first to my {s11}, {s4}.
dlga_start:close_window.78|I do not know where to find my {s11} {s10}, who by tradition should preside over our wedding. Perhaps we should wait until he can be found...
dlga_start:close_window.79|The honorable {s12} has agreed to allow us to return home to our families. We shall be departing shortly.
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive|So great is my loneliness! How I miss my family!
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.1|You are a cad, {sir/madame}, to hold a lady like this...
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.2|It is strange. On occasion you have shown me such kindness, and yet you continue to hold me here against my will.
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.3|Why haven't my family paid my ransom? You may hold me as prisoner, but it seems that you care for me more than they do!
dlga_lady_stranded_next:close_window|Greetings, {sir/my lady}. The tides of war have left me stranded here in this fortress, but I will shortly be departing.
dlga_start:lady_talk_refugee|{playername} -- I assume that you, as a {man/lady} of honor, will accord gentle-born ladies such as ourselves the right to return to our families, and not demand a ransom.
dlga_start:close_window.80|We will shortly depart{s5}. It is good to know that some people in this world retain a sense of honor.
dlga_lady_talk_refugee:close_window|Of course, my lady
dlga_lady_talk_refugee:lady_captive_talk|You assume wrong, my lady!
dlga_lady_captive_talk:lady_captive_confirm|What?! What infamy is this?
dlga_lady_captive_confirm:close_window|My apologies - you must have misunderstood me. Of course you may leave.
dlga_lady_captive_confirm:close_window.1|Contact your family to arrange for a ransom, my lady.
dlga_kingdom_lady_captive:close_window|Then write to your family, and ask them to hurry up with the ransom!
dlga_kingdom_lady_captive:close_window.1|I have changed my mind -- you are free to go, 
dlga_start:close_window.81|Well, {playername} -- you fought a duel with {s10}, and lost. According to our custom and tradition, I should no longer receive you. Farewell, {playername}.
dlga_start:lady_duel_lost|Oh {playername} -- I heard of your duel with {s10}. I wish now that you had never fought him, for our honor and tradition demand that, having lost to him, you now break off your suit with me. Farewell, {playername}.

dlga_lady_duel_lost:lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions|Let honor and tradition hang!
dlga_lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions:close_window|Oh, {playername}! Although people will talk, it would so break my heart to no longer be able to see you. We shall ignore this silly, cruel tradition.
dlga_lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions:close_window.1|No, {playername} -- I cannot afford to fritter away my good name, and neither can you.
dlga_start:lady_start|Oh, {playername} -- I have heard that you won your duel with {s10}. I'm grateful that you have delivered me from that man's attentions!
dlga_start:lady_start.1|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Clearly, he was not worthy of my affections.
dlga_lady_duel_rep_1:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Oh, such foolishness, that men should fight over me! Sigh... But it is a bit romantic, I suppose.
dlga_lady_duel_rep_2:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Honor now demands that he and I no longer meet... I was fond of him, you know. You did me no service by fighting him, sir.
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1|My dear {playername}, how joyous to see you again! I heard you gave that vile {s13} a well-deserved lesson. I hope he never forgets his humiliation. I've a reward for you, but I fear it's little compared to what you've done for me.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2|Oh, it will just have to do.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.1|{s66}, this is far too much!
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.2|Please, {s65}, no reward is necessary.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2:lady_pretalk|{s10}, 
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed|I was told that you sought satisfaction from {s13} to prove my innocence, {playername}. It was a fine gesture, and I thank you for your efforts.
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2|I beg your forgiveness for my defeat, {s65}...
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2:lady_pretalk|It matters not, dear {playername}. You tried. The truth cannot be proven at the point of a sword, but you willingly put your life at stake for my honour. That alone will convince many of my innocence.
dlga_start:lady_escort_lady_succeeded|Thank you for escorting me here, {playername}. Please accept this gift as a token of my gratitude. I hope we shall meet again sometime in the future.
dlga_lady_escort_lady_succeeded:close_window|It was an honor to serve you, {s65}.
dlga_start:lady_start.2|Ah {playername} - you must have received my message. How happy I am that you could come!
dlga_start:lady_proposal_pending|{playername} - is there any word from my family?
dlga_start:lady_betrothed|I hear that my {s11} has refused your request to marry me. Does that mean that we must part?
dlga_start:lady_generic_mission_succeeded|Oh, {playername}, you brought him back to me! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.
dlga_start:rescue_prisoner_succeed_1|Oh, {playername}, you brought him back to me! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.
dlga_rescue_prisoner_succeed_1:lady_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.
dlga_start:lady_meet_end|You must be {playername}. We have just had the honor of watching you distinguish yourself in the recent tournament{s8}.
dlga_start:lady_meet_end.1|You must be {playername}. My {s15} {s16} has spoken most highly of you. I am delighted to make your acquaintance.
dlga_start:lady_premeet|I say, you don't look familiar...
dlga_start:close_window.82|Ah, {playername}. How good it is to see you again. However, I believe that I am required elsewhere.
dlga_start:lady_start.3|{playername} -- how good it is to see you. (Whispers:) I still remember your visits fondly.
dlga_start:lady_meet_end.2|Ah, {playername}. How spendid it was to see you distinguish yourself in the recent tournament.
dlga_start:lady_start.4|{s12}, 
dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed|I have sad news. I have become betrothed to {s5} -- against my will, I should say! Oh {playername} - I would so much rather be wed to you!
dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed.1|Good {playername} -- I have become betrothed to {s5}. It is now no longer seemly for us to see each other like this.
dlga_lady_start:lady_other_suitor|I must tell you -- there is another lord who has been paying me attentions, although I cannot abide him. I fear he has designs on me, and may try to force me to wed against my will.
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk|{s11}It is probably not suitable for us to tarry too long here in conversation, but I would hope to see you again soon.
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.1|{s11}, 
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.2|I was planning to retire for a little while, but perhaps we may have a chance to speak more later...
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.3|It is so delightful to have a chance to spend some time together.{s12}, 
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.4|What brings you here today?
dlga_lady_proposal_pending:close_window|No word so far...
dlga_lady_proposal_pending:lady_proposal_pending_end|On second thought, now is not the time for us to marry
dlga_lady_proposal_pending_end:close_window|{s11}, 
dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_suggest_elope|Never! We must elope together at once!
dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_pretalk|Perhaps I may still be able to change your {s11}'s mind, 
dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_conclude_relationship|So be it -- let us then part, 
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship|Good {playername} -- you are a good and kind man, but a lady cannot defy her family. Such things are not done!
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_other_suitor|Sir -- as you may know, I have been entertaining offers from a number of gentlemen such as yourself. I am not yet at a stage where I can commit to any of them.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.1|Ah {playername}, you must realize. You are still finding your way in the world. I have great affection for you, {playername}, but I will not consign myself to obscurity.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.2|Ah {playername}, although you are kind to me, I am not certain enough of your moral fiber to risk such a thing. Although I bare little affection for my husband, it would be a weighty thing to go against my family's wishes, and I am not certain enough of you to take that step.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.3|Good {playername} -- to elope would be to throw away my ties with my family, which are everything to me! I have a considerable affection for you, but I am not sure that I am prepared to risk that.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.4|Good {playername} -- I am not used to the hardships of campaigning as you are. I want a home to call my own. If you were lord of a castle or town with a great hall, I would gladly go there as your wife, to be mistress of the household. But I do not wish to live like a hunted animal.
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_elope_agree|Elope with you? Yes -- we could do that. It is a great step to defy my family -- but a loveless marriage, and life without you, might be a far worse thing! But be warned -- this will be a terrible blow to my {s11}'s prestige, and he will do everything in his power to bring you down.
dlga_lady_elope_agree:lady_elope_agree_nurse|Quickly, then! There is no time to lose.
dlga_lady_elope_agree:close_window|Everything in his power, you say? Em... Let me think about this...
dlga_lady_elope_agree_nurse:lady_elope_agree_lady_vows|Your lordship... Your ladyship... Would you like me to witness your exchange of vows?
dlga_lady_elope_agree_lady_vows:lady_elope_agree_nurse_2|Yes, do that. For my part, I make the following vow: I, {s4}, do swear that I accept {playername} as my husband, according to the ancient law and custom of our land...
dlga_lady_elope_agree_nurse_2:lady_elope_agree_player_vows|Very good. Do you, {playername}, swear similarly to accept {s4} as your wife?
dlga_lady_elope_agree_player_vows:close_window|I do.
dlga_lady_elope_agree_player_vows:close_window.1|Eh, what? This is all moving too fast...
dlga_lady_elope_agree:lady_conclude_relationship|Oh, really? My dear -- I could never separate a lady from her family like that...
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm|So I suppose our time together must come to an end...
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_yes|Yes -- it must be...
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_no|Wait -- perhaps there is still a chance for us!
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_yes:close_window|Farewell, {playername}. We will see each other, in the courts and castles of this realm, but we must keep our distance from each other. I will remember these days fondly, nonetheless.
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_no:close_window|In that case, we shall see what the future brings.
dlga_lady_generic_mission_succeeded:lady_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.
dlga_lady_premeet:lady_meet|I am {playername}.
dlga_lady_premeet:lady_meet.1|My name is {playername}. At your service.
dlga_lady_meet:lady_meet_end|Of course. How splendid to finally make your acquaintance.
dlga_lady_meet:lady_meet_end.1|{playername}? I do not believe I've heard of you before.
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk|I am about to retire for a little while, but perhaps we may have a chance to speak more later...
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk.1|Now, if you will excuse me...
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk.2|Can I help you with anything?
dlga_lady_talk:lord_talk_ask_location|I want to know the location of someone.
dlga_lady_pretalk:lady_talk|Now, if you will excuse me...
dlga_lady_pretalk:lady_talk.1|Is there anything else?
dlga_lady_talk:lady_relations|May I have the honor of knowing more about you, my lady?
dlga_lady_relations:lady_pretalk|{s12}, 
dlga_lady_talk:lady_profess_admiration|My lady, I would like to profess myself your most ardent admirer
dlga_lady_talk:lady_tournament_dedication_reaction|My lady, I would like to dedicate my successes in this recent tournament to you
dlga_lady_tournament_dedication_reaction:lady_pretalk|{s9}, 
dlga_lady_profess_admiration:close_window|{s11}I would like it very much if we could see more of each other.
dlga_lady_profess_admiration:lady_pretalk|Ah... You are too kind... My, the hour is getting rather late, isn't it? I really must be going.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_recite_poetry|Do you like poetry, my lady?
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry|That would depend on the poem. Did you intend to recite a verse?
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response|The wind that blows the dry steppe dust...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.1|All the silks of Veluca/All the furs of Khudan...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.2|You are the first and the last/the outer and the inner...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.3|A light pierced the gloom over Wercheg cliffs...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.4|I deflected her skeptical questioning darts/with armor made of purest devotion...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_pretalk|Actually, I can't think of any that I would care to recite...
dlga_lady_recite_poetry_response:lady_private_conversation_end|{s11}, 
dlga_lady_private_conversation_end:lady_pretalk|Time is passing quickly, and we cannot linger here too long.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_marriage_discussion|Do you think that we may have a future together, my lady?
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_other_suitor|Sir -- as you may know, I have been entertaining offers from a number of gentlemen such as yourself. I am not yet at a stage where I can commit to any of them.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_proposal_refused|It is good to hear that you are thinking seriously about the future. However, I would like to see you rise a little further in the world before I am ready to commit to marry you.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_proposal_refused.1|It is good to hear that your intentions are honorable. However, I have resolved only to marry a man of the strongest moral fiber. I would like you to prove yourself more in that regard.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_proposal_refused.2|Sir -- it is comforting to hear that your intentions towards me are honorable. But perhaps we should take the time to get to allow our affections for each other to grow a little stronger, before making any such decision.
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_betrothed|Oh {playername}, how happy that would make me! But my {s11} {s4} would never allow it... Perhaps it is best that we part...
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:close_window|Oh {playername}, how happy that would make me! Go ask my {s11} {s4} for permission!
dlga_lady_proposal_refused:lady_proposal_refused_persuade_check|Perhaps I can persuade you to delay no further.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_check:lady_proposal_refused_persuade_player_response|What do you have to say?
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_player_response:lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result|Love is as a rose, my lady. Left unplucked, it may wither.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_player_response:lady_pretalk|Oh, never mind.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result:close_window|Enough, sir! I shall not be rushed into marriage, with you or with anyone else! You have made me very cross. Please, leave me alone for a while. I shall let you know when I am ready to speak to you again.
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result:lady_betrothed|Oh {playername}, I could never allow that to happen! Oh, if only we could be wed! But my {s11} {s4} would never give his permission... Perhaps it is best that we part...
dlga_lady_proposal_refused_persuade_result:close_window.1|Oh {playername}, I could never allow that to happen! Go ask my {s11} {s4} his permission for us to be wed!
dlga_lady_proposal_refused:close_window|Very well -- I shall continue to strive to be worthy of your esteem!
dlga_lady_proposal_refused:lady_player_threatens_compel|I am tired of these games! I will speak to your family about arranging a wedding immediately..
dlga_lady_player_threatens_compel:lady_player_threatens_compel_2|What? Do you mean that?
dlga_lady_player_threatens_compel_2:lady_private_conversation_end|No, of couse not. Please forgive my burst of temper
dlga_lady_player_threatens_compel_2:close_window|Yes -- you clearly do not know what is in your best interests.
dlga_lady_other_suitor:lady_pretalk|It grieves me to hear that, my lady, but such things must be, 
dlga_lady_other_suitor:lady_other_suitor_challenge|Who is the miscreant! Tell me his name!
dlga_lady_other_suitor:lady_player_threatens_compel|I am tired of these games! I will demand that your family compel you to marry me..
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_pretalk|I would be so grateful! But from what I understand, you already have a duel on your hands. He is not honor-bound to fight you, if you are committed to another combat. Please, conclude your other business in a hurry, to rescue me from that man's attentions!.
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_pretalk.1|Ah! Such talk. But from what I hear, you already have a duel on your hands. Finish one before you start another! Sigh... You men can be so silly...
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm|It is {s5}. Please, rescue me from that man's attentions!
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm.1|Will you now? This should be interesting. Very well. Your rival is {s5}. Let us see which of you has the greater mettle.
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm.2|Oh, fie! I wish that this were not a matter of honor, so I could refuse such a request. But alas, I feel compelled to tell you that your rival is {s5}. I wish that heaven had not granted me such a fair visage, so that I would not inspire such passions in men!
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm.3|I will have none of such talk! It is nonsense for you and {s5} to fight over -- whoops! I beg of you, sir, forget the name that just escaped my lips...
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_yes|So be it! I shall challenge him to a trial of arms!
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm:lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_no|On second thought, I let my passions run away with me there. Never mind.
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_yes:lady_pretalk|{s15}, 
dlga_lady_other_suitor_challenge_confirm_no:lady_private_conversation_end|Good. You are wise not to let your temper guide you.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_ask_for_quest|Is there anything I can do to win your favour?
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk|I don't have anything else for you to do right now.
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told|Oh, I fear I may never see my {s17}, {s13}, again... He is a prisoner in the dungeon of {s14}. We have tried to negotiate his ransom, but it has been set too high. We can never hope to raise that much money without selling everything we own, and God knows {s13} would rather spend his life in prison than make us destitute. Instead I came up with a plan to get him out of there, but it requires someone to make a great sacrifice, and so far my pleas have fallen on deaf ears...
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told.1|My poor {s11}, {s13}, is a prisoner in the {s14} dungeons. The only way we can talk to each other is by exchanging letters whenever we can, but the journey is so dangerous that we get little chance to do so. Please, would you deliver one for me?
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_quest_duel_for_lady|Dear {playername}, you are kind to ask, but you know little of my troubles and I can't possibly ask you to throw yourself into danger on my behalf.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2|Tell me what the problem is, and I can make my own decision.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3|Very well, as you wish it... My husband has made certain enemies in his life, {playername}. One of the most insidious is {s13}. He is going around making terrible accusations against me, impugning my honour at every turn! Because he cannot harm my husband directly, he is using me as a target to try and stain our name. You should hear the awful things he's said! I only wish there was someone brave enough to make him recant his slander, but {s13} is a very fine swordsman, and he's widely feared..
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted|I fear him not, {s65}. I will make him take back his lies.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted:close_window|Oh! I can't ask that of you, {playername}, but... I would be forever indebted to you, and you are so sure. It would mean so much if you would defend my honour. Thank you a thousand times, all my prayers and my favour go with you.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected|If he's that dangerous, perhaps maybe it would be better to ignore him...
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected:close_window|Oh... Perhaps you're right, {playername}. I should let go of these silly childhood ideas of chivalry and courage. {Men/People} are not like that, not anymore. Good day to you.
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk.1|No, {playername}, I've no need for a champion right now.
dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_accepted|As you wish it, {s65}, it shall be done.
dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_rejected|{s66}, I fear I cannot help you right now.
dlga_lady_mission_accepted:close_window|You are a true {gentleman/lady}, {playername}. Thank you so much for helping me
dlga_lady_mission_rejected:close_window|You'll not help a woman in need? You should be ashamed, {playername}... Please leave me, I have some important embroidery to catch up.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_restore_relation|I want to improve my relation with a lord. Can you help me?
dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_pretalk|{playername}, I don't know you well enough to act on your behalf. I am sorry.
dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_restore_relation_2|Hmm. I guess you got on the wrong side of somebody. Very well, who do you want to restore your relation with?
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_restore_relation_2b|{s1}, 
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_pretalk|Never mind. I get along with everyone well enough.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2b:lady_restore_relation_3|Well I can try to help you there. I am sure a few expensive gifts will make {s10} look at you more favorably.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_3:lady_restore_relation_4|You can improve your relation with {s10} by sending {reg4?her:him} a gift worth {reg10} denars. But if you can afford spending {reg11} denars on the gift, it would make a good impression on {reg4?her:him}. And if you can go up to {reg12} denars, that would really help smooth things out.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5|I think a gift of {reg10} denars will do.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.1|Maybe I can afford {reg11} denars.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.2|In that case, I am ready to spend {reg12} denars.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_cant_afford|I don't think I can afford a gift at the moment.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_5:lady_restore_relation_6|Excellent. Then I'll choose an appropriate gift for you and send it to {s10} with your compliments. I am sure {reg4?she:he} will appreciate the gesture.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_6:lady_pretalk|Thank you for your help, madame.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_cant_afford:lady_pretalk|I am afraid, I can't be of much help in that case, {playername}. I am sorry.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_leave|I must beg my leave.
dlga_lady_leave:close_window|{s12}, 
dlga_convince_begin:convince_options|I still don't see why I should accept what you're asking of me.
dlga_convince_options:convince_bribe|Then I'll make it worth your while. ({reg8} denars), 
dlga_convince_options:convince_friendship|Please, do it for the sake of our friendship. (-{reg9} to relation)
dlga_convince_options:convince_persuade_begin|Let me try and convince you. (Persuasion), 
dlga_convince_options:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_convince_bribe:convince_bribe_verify|Mmm, a generous gift to my coffers would certainly help matters... {reg8} denars should do it. If you agree, then I'll go with your suggestion.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_bribe_cant_afford|I'm afraid my finances will not allow for such a gift.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_bribe_goon|Very well, please accept these {reg8} denars as a token of my gratitude.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_begin|Let me think about this some more.
dlga_convince_bribe_cant_afford:convince_options|Ah. In that case, there is little I can do, unless you have some further argument to make.
dlga_convince_bribe_goon:convince_accept|My dear {playername}, your generous gift has led me to reconsider what you ask, and I have come to appreciate the wisdom of your proposal.
dlga_convince_friendship:convince_friendship_verify|You've done well by me in the past, {playername}, and for that I will go along with your request, but know that I do not like you using our relationship this way.
dlga_convince_friendship_verify:convince_friendship_go_on|I am sorry, my friend, but I need your help in this.
dlga_convince_friendship_verify:lord_pretalk|If it will not please you, then I'll try something else.
dlga_convince_friendship_go_on:convince_accept|All right then, {playername}, I will accept this for your sake. But remember, you owe me for this.
dlga_convince_friendship:lord_pretalk|I don't think I owe you such a favor {playername}. I see no reason to accept this for you.
dlga_convince_friendship:lord_pretalk.1|Is this a joke? You've some nerve asking me for favours, {playername}, and let me assure you you'll get none.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin:convince_persuade_begin_2|Very well. Make your case.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin_2:convince_persuade|[Attempt to persuade], 
dlga_convince_persuade_begin_2:convince_begin|Wait, perhaps there is another way to convince you.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin:lord_pretalk|By God's grace, {playername}! Haven't we talked enough already? I am tired of listening to you, and I do not want to hear any more of it right now.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_accept|All right, all right. You have persuaded me to it. I'll go ahead with what you suggest.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options|You've a point, {playername}, I'll admit that much. However I am not yet convinced I should do as you bid.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.1|Enough, {playername}. You've a lot of arguments, but I find none of them truly convincing. I stand by what I said before.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.2|Truthfully, {playername}, I fail to see the virtue of your reasoning. What you ask for makes even less sense now than it did before.
dlga_start:siege_won_seneschal_1|I must congratulate you on your victory, my {lord/lady}. Welcome to {s1}. We, the housekeepers of this castle, are at your service.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_1:siege_won_seneschal_2|Are you the seneschal?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_2:siege_won_seneschal_3|Indeed I am, my {lord/lady}. I have always served the masters of {s1} to the best of my ability, whichever side they might be on. Thus you may count on my utmost loyalty for as long as you are the {lord/lady} of this place. Now, do you intend to keep me on as the seneschal? I promise you will not be disappointed.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4|Very well, you may keep your post for the time being.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4.1|You can stay, but I shall be keeping a close watch on you.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_4:siege_won_seneschal_5|Thank you, my {lord/lady}. If you do not mind my impudence, may I inquire as to what you wish to do with the castle?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6|I will sell it to another lord.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6.1|I intend to claim it for myself.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_list_options|I haven't given it much thought. What are my options?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|According to our laws and traditions, you can do one of several things. First, you could station a garrison here to protect the castle from any immediate counterattacks, then request an audience with some wealthy lord and ask him to make you an offer. It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me. If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a liege lord and protector who would accept homage from you. Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to the castle. Both you and {s1} would become great big targets for any man with a few soldiers and a scrap of ambition.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3|What do you mean, a liege lord and protector? I won this place by my own hand, I don't need anyone else!
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4|Of course you don't, my {lord/lady}. However, no lord in the land will recognize your claim to the castle unless it is verified by royal decree. They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold and take it from you at the earliest opportunity. Surely not even you could stand against a whole army.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4:siege_won_seneschal_6|Hmm. I'll give it some thought.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_6:close_window|I am very pleased to hear it, my {lord/lady}. I am only trying to serve you to the best of my ability. Now, if at any time you find you have further need of me, I will be in the great hall arranging a smooth handover of the castle to your forces.
dlga_start:seneschal_intro_1|Good day, {sir/madam}. I do nott believe I've seen you here before. Let me extend my welcome to you as the seneschal of {s1}.
dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1a|A pleasure to meet you, {s65}.
dlga_seneschal_intro_1a:seneschal_talk|How can I help you?
dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1b|What exactly do you do here?
dlga_seneschal_intro_1b:seneschal_talk|Ah, a seneschal's duties are many, good {sire/woman}. For example, I collect the rents from my lord's estates, I manage the castle's storerooms, I deal with the local peasantry, I take care of castle staff, I arrange supplies for the garrison... All mundane matters on this fief are my responsibility, on behalf of my lord. Everything except commanding the soldiers themselves, 
dlga_start:seneschal_talk|Good day, {sir/madam}.
dlga_seneschal_pretalk:seneschal_talk|Anything else?
dlga_seneschal_talk:seneschal_ask_something|I would like to ask you a question...
dlga_seneschal_talk:seneschal_ask_about_someone|I wish to know more about someone...
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone:seneschal_ask_about_someone_2|Perhaps I may be able to help. Whom did you have in mind?
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_2:seneschal_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_seneschal_talk:close_window|I must take my leave of you now. Farewell.
dlga_seneschal_ask_something:seneschal_ask_something_2|I'll do what I can to help, of course. What did you wish to ask?
dlga_seneschal_ask_something_2:seneschal_ask_location|Perhaps you know where to find someone...
dlga_seneschal_ask_location:seneschal_ask_location_2|Well, a man in my position does hear a lot of things. Of whom were you thinking?
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_2:seneschal_ask_location_3|{s1}, 
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_2:seneschal_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_3:seneschal_pretalk|{s1}, 
dlga_start:close_window.83|There! I can see the walls of {s3} in the distance. We've made it safely. Here, take this purse of {reg3} denars, as I promised. I hope we can travel together again someday.
dlga_start:talk_caravan_escort|We've made it this far... Is everything clear up ahead?
dlga_talk_caravan_escort:talk_caravan_escort_2a|There might be bandits nearby. Stay close.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort_2a:close_window|Trust me, {playername}, we're already staying as close to you as we can. Lead the way.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort:talk_caravan_escort_2b|No sign of trouble, we can breathe easy.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort_2b:close_window|I'll breathe easy when we reach {s1} and not a moment sooner. Let's keep moving.
dlga_start:merchant_talk|What do you want? We paid our toll to you less than three days ago.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.1|Hail, friend.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.2|What do you want? We are but simple merchants, we've no quarrel with you, so leave us alone.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.3|Be warned, knave! This caravan is under the protection of {s9}. Step out of our way or you will face his fury!
dlga_start:merchant_talk.4|Yes? What do you want?
dlga_merchant_pretalk:merchant_talk|Anything else?
dlga_merchant_talk:caravan_start_war_quest_1|You are trespassing in the territory of the {s17}. I am confiscating this caravan and all its goods!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_1:caravan_start_war_quest_2|What? What nonsense is this? We are at peace with the {s17}, and are free to cross its lands!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_2:merchant_attack|We'll see about that! Defend yourselves!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_2:close_window|Hmm. Maybe this was all a misunderstanding. Farewell.
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_talk_offer|I have an offer for you.
dlga_merchant_talk_offer:merchant_talk_offer_2|What is it?
dlga_merchant_talk_offer_2:caravan_offer_protection|I can escort you to your destination for a price.
dlga_merchant_talk_offer_2:merchant_pretalk|Nothing. Forget it, 
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_bandit_information|I am hunting a group of bandits with the following description... Have you seen them?
dlga_merchant_bandit_information:merchant_pretalk|{s15}, 
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_trip_explanation|Tell me about your journey, 
dlga_merchant_trip_explanation:merchant_pretalk|We are coming from {s11} and heading to {s12}.{s14}, 
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_demand|I demand something from you!
dlga_merchant_demand:merchant_demand_2|What do you want?
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_demand_toll|There is a toll for free passage here!
dlga_merchant_demand_toll:merchant_demand_toll_2|Please, I don't want any trouble. I can give you {reg6} denars, just let us go.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll:merchant_demand_toll_2.1|I don't want any trouble. I can give you {reg6} denars if you'll let us go.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_demand_toll_accept|Agreed, hand it over and you may go in peace.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_accept:close_window|Very well then. Here's {reg6} denars.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_pretalk|I changed my mind, I can't take your money.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_attack|No, I want everything you have! [Attack]
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_attack_begin|Hand over your gold and valuables now!
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_pretalk|Nothing. Forget it.
dlga_merchant_attack_begin:merchant_attack_verify|Are you robbing us?{s11}, 
dlga_merchant_attack_verify:merchant_attack_verify_norob|Robbing you? No, no! It was a joke.
dlga_merchant_attack_verify_norob:close_window|God, don't joke about that, {lad/lass}. For a moment I thought we were in real trouble.
dlga_merchant_attack_verify:merchant_attack|Of course I'm robbing you. Now hand over your goods.
dlga_merchant_attack:close_window|Damn you, you won't get anything from us without a fight!
dlga_caravan_offer_protection:caravan_offer_protection_2|These roads are dangerous indeed. One can never have enough protection.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_2:close_window|An escort? We're almost there already! Thank you for the offer, though.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_2:caravan_offer_protection_3|We are heading to {s1}. I will pay you {reg2} denars if you escort us there.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_3:caravan_offer_protection_4|Agreed.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_4:caravan_offer_protection_5|I want you to stay close to us along the way. We'll need your help if we get ambushed by bandits.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_5:caravan_offer_protection_6|Don't worry, you can trust me.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_6:close_window|Good. Come and collect your money when we're within sight of {s1}. For now, let's just get underway.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_3:caravan_offer_protection_4b|Forget it.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_4b:close_window|Perhaps another time, then.
dlga_merchant_talk:talk_caravan_enemy_2|Not so fast. First, hand over all your goods and money.
dlga_talk_caravan_enemy_2:close_window|Never. It is our duty to protect these goods. You shall have to fight us, brigand!
dlga_merchant_talk:close_window|[Leave], 
dlga_start:prison_guard_players|Good day, my {lord/lady}. Will you be visiting the prison?
dlga_prison_guard_players:close_window|Yes. Unlock the door.
dlga_prison_guard_players:close_window.1|No, not now.
dlga_start:prison_guard_talk|Yes? What do you want?
dlga_prison_guard_talk:prison_guard_ask_prisoners|Who is imprisoned here?
dlga_prison_guard_talk:prison_guard_visit_prison|I want to speak with a prisoner.
dlga_prison_guard_ask_prisoners:prison_guard_talk|Currently, {s50} {reg1?are:is} imprisoned here.{s49}
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:close_window|Of course, {sir/madam}. Go in.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:prison_guard_visit_prison_2|You need to get permission from the lord to talk to prisoners.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody|There is nobody inside, therefore you can freely go inside and look around.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody:close_window|All right then. I'll take a look at the prison.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody:close_window.1|I have more important business to do.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:close_window|All right then. I'll try that.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:prison_guard_visit_prison_3|Come on now. I thought you were the boss here.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_3:prison_guard_visit_prison_4|He-heh. You got that right. Still, I can't let you into the prison.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:close_window|All right then. I'll leave now.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:prison_guard_visit_prison_5|I found a purse with 100 denars a few paces away. I reckon it belongs to you.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_5:close_window|Ah! I was looking for this all day. How good of you to bring it back {sir/madam}. Well, now that I know what an honest {man/lady} you are, there can be no harm in letting you inside for a look. Go in.... Just so you know, though -- I'll be hanging onto the keys, in case you were thinking about undoing anyone's chains.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:prison_guard_visit_break|Give me the keys to the cells -- now!
dlga_prison_guard_visit_break:close_window|Help! Help! Prison break!
dlga_prison_guard_talk:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_start:castle_guard_players|Your orders, {Lord/Lady}?
dlga_castle_guard_players:close_window|Open the door. I'll go in.
dlga_castle_guard_players:close_window.1|Never mind.
dlga_start:castle_guard_sneaked_intro_1|Get out of my sight, beggar! You stink!
dlga_start:close_window.84|Get lost before I lose my temper you vile beggar!
dlga_castle_guard_sneaked_intro_1:castle_guard_sneaked_intro_2|I want to enter the hall and speak to the lord.
dlga_castle_guard_sneaked_intro_1:close_window|[Leave], 
dlga_castle_guard_sneaked_intro_2:close_window|Are you out of your mind, {man/woman}? Beggars are not allowed into the hall. Now get lost or I'll beat you bloody.
dlga_start:castle_guard_intro_1|What do you want?
dlga_castle_guard_intro_1:castle_guard_intro_2|I want to enter the hall and speak to the lord.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_1:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:close_window|I'm afraid there is a feast in progress, and you are not invited.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:castle_guard_intro_3|You can go in after leaving your weapons with me. No one is allowed to carry arms into the lord's hall.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_3:close_window|Here, take my arms. I'll go in.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_3:castle_guard_intro_2b|No, I give my arms to no one.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2b:close_window|Then you can't go in.
dlga_start:castle_gate_guard_talk|What do you want?
dlga_castle_gate_guard_pretalk:castle_gate_guard_talk|Yes?
dlga_castle_gate_guard_talk:castle_gate_open|We need shelter for the night. Will you let us in?
dlga_castle_gate_guard_talk:request_meeting_castle_lord|I want to speak with the lord of the castle.
dlga_castle_gate_guard_talk:request_meeting_other|I want to speak with someone in the castle.
dlga_castle_gate_guard_talk:close_window|[Leave], 
dlga_request_meeting_castle_lord:close_window|Wait here. {s2} will see you.
dlga_request_meeting_castle_lord:castle_gate_guard_pretalk|My lord is not here now.
dlga_request_meeting_other:request_meeting_3|Who is that?
dlga_request_meeting_3:request_meeting_4|{s3}, 
dlga_request_meeting_3:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_request_meeting_4:request_meeting_5|Wait there. I'll send him your request.
dlga_request_meeting_5:request_meeting_6|I'm waiting...
dlga_request_meeting_6:close_window|All right. {s2} will talk to you now.
dlga_request_meeting_6:close_window.1|{s2} says he will not see you. Begone now.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window|My lord {s2} will be happy to see you {sir/madam}. Come on in. I am opening the gates for you.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window.1|My lord {s2} is not in the castle now. But I think he would approve of you taking shelter here. Come on in. I am opening the gates for you.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window.2|Come on in. I am opening the gates for you.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window.3|Come on in. But make sure your men behave sensibly within the walls. My lord {s2} does not want trouble here.
dlga_castle_gate_open:close_window.4|My lord {s2} does not want you here. Begone now.
dlga_przquest:close_window.7|You are not ready to take next orders yet.
dlga_start:close_window.85|You have come just in time. Let us join our forces now and teach our enemy a lesson.
dlga_start:close_window.86|You are making a big mistake by fighting against us.
dlga_start:ally_thanks_meet|I don't think we have met properly my friend. You just saved my life out there, and I still don't know your name...
dlga_start:ally_thanks_meet.1|Your help was most welcome stranger. My name is {s1}. Can I learn yours?
dlga_start:ally_thanks_meet.2|Thanks for your help, stranger. We haven't met properly yet, have we? What is your name?
dlga_ally_thanks_meet:ally_thanks_meet_2|My name is {playername}.
dlga_ally_thanks_meet_2:close_window|Well met indeed {playername}. My name is {s1} and I am forever in your debt. If there is ever anything I can help you with, just let me know...
dlga_ally_thanks_meet_2:close_window.1|Well met {playername}. I am in your debt for what you just did. I hope one day I will find a way to repay it.
dlga_ally_thanks_meet_2:close_window.2|Well met {playername}. I am {s1}. Thanks for your help and I hope we meet again.
dlga_start:close_window.87|Again you save our necks, {playername}! Truly, you are the best of friends. {s43}, 
dlga_start:close_window.88|You arrived just in the nick of time! {playername}. You have my deepest thanks! {s43}, 
dlga_start:close_window.89|You turned up just in time, {playername}. I will not forget your help. {s43}
dlga_start:close_window.90|Good to see you here, {playername}. {s43}
dlga_start:close_window.91|{s43}, 
dlga_start:close_window.92|{s43}, 
dlga_start:close_window.93|Thank you for your help {sir/madam}. You saved {reg1?our lives:my life} out there.
dlga_start:close_window.94|Thank you for your help {sir/madam}. Things didn't look very well for us but then you came up and everything changed.
dlga_start:close_window.95|Thank you for your help, {sir/madam}. It was fortunate to have you nearby.
dlga_start:kidnapped_girl_liberated_map|Komu mam być wdzięczny za ocalenie?
dlga_start:freed_hero_answer|I am in your debt for freeing me friend.
dlga_freed_hero_answer:freed_hero_answer_1|You're not going anywhere. You'll be my prisoner now!
dlga_freed_hero_answer_1:close_window|Alas. Will my luck never change?
dlga_freed_hero_answer:freed_hero_answer_2|You're free to go, {s65}.
dlga_freed_hero_answer_2:close_window|Thank you, good {sire/lady}. I never forget someone who's done me a good turn.
dlga_freed_hero_answer:freed_hero_answer_3|Would you like to join me?
dlga_freed_hero_answer_3:close_window|All right I will join you.
dlga_freed_hero_answer_3:close_window.1|No, I want to go on my own.
dlga_start:defeat_hero_answer|You'll not live long to enjoy your victory. My kinsmen will soon wipe out the stain of this defeat.
dlga_defeat_hero_answer:defeat_hero_answer_1|You are my prisoner now.
dlga_defeat_hero_answer_1:close_window|Damn you. You will regret this.
dlga_defeat_hero_answer:defeat_hero_answer_2|You're free to go this time, but don't cross my path again.
dlga_defeat_hero_answer_2:close_window|We will meet again.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested|{s9}, 
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window|I think that is a wise move. Good luck to you.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.1|Your relations with {s4} are not all that they could be. As {reg4?she:he} is my {s11}, I can mediate to attempt to mend your quarrel. Perhaps the best way for me to do this would be to send {reg4?her:him} a gift -- a fur-trimmed velvet robe, perhaps. If you can provide me with a bolt of velvet and a length of furs, I can have one made and sent to {reg4?her:him.}
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.1|Splendid. I shall await the materials.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.2|As you may realize, {s4} has many enemies among the lords of the {s5}. In particular, they feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to denounce {s4} to {reg4?her:his} face, you may reap much popularity -- although, of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him}, and risk being challenged to a duel.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.3|As you may realize, many of us in the peerage of the {s5} consider {s4} to be {s7}, and a liability to our cause. We worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. People know my views on {s4} already, but if you were to denounce {reg4?her:him} to {reg4?her:his} face, you would further erode his standing -- and discourage our liege from entrusting {reg4?her:him} with any more power or responsibility. Of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him}, and risk being challenged to a duel.{s9}, 
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.2|We appreciate what you are doing. I find such intrigues distasteful, but it is all for the good of the {s5}.
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.3|Very well. It is always risky to involve yourself in intrigues of this sort, but in this case, I think you will benefit.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.4|You and I have a common interest in seeking to curtail the rise of {s4}. I feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to tell our liege {s9} your opinion of {s4}, it might discourage {s9} from granting {s4} any further powers or responsibilities, at least for a while, and I would be much obliged to you.
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.4|We appreciate what you are doing. I find such intrigues distasteful, but it is all for the good of the {s5}.
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.5|I cannot think of anything right now, but we will have some items of mutual interest in the future.
dlga_political_quest_suggested:political_quest_follow_on|I like that idea.
dlga_political_quest_suggested:combined_political_quests|Hmm.. Maybe you can think of something else?
dlga_political_quest_suggested:political_quests_end|Let us discuss another topic, 
dlga_political_quests_end:lord_pretalk|Very well.
dlga_political_quests_end:spouse_pretalk|Very well.
dlga_political_quests_end:minister_pretalk|Very well.
dlga_political_quests_end:close_window|Very well.
dlga_start:local_merchant_mercy|Mercy! Please don't kill me!
dlga_local_merchant_mercy:local_merchant_mercy_no|I have nothing against you man. But {s2} wants you dead. Sorry.
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_no:close_window|Damn you! May you burn in Hell!
dlga_local_merchant_mercy:local_merchant_mercy_yes|I'll let you live, if you promise me...
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes:local_merchant_mercy_yes_2|Of course, I promise, I'll do anything. Just spare my life...
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_2:local_merchant_mercy_yes_3|You are going to forget about {s2}'s debt to you. And you will sign a paper stating that he owes you nothing.
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_3:local_merchant_mercy_yes_4|Yes, of course. I'll do as you say.
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_4:local_merchant_mercy_yes_5|And if my lord hears so much of a hint of a complaint about this issue, then I'll come back for you, and it won't matter how much you scream for mercy then. Do you understand me?
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_5:local_merchant_mercy_yes_6|Yes {sir/madam}. Don't worry. I won't make any complaint.
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_6:close_window|Good. Go now, before I change my mind.
dlga_start:fugitive_1|What do you want?
dlga_fugitive_1:fugitive_2|I am looking for a murderer by the name of {s4}. You fit his description.
dlga_fugitive_1:close_window|Nothing. Sorry to trouble you.
dlga_fugitive_2:fugitive_3|I don't understand, {sir/madam}. I never killed anyone. I think you've got the wrong man.
dlga_fugitive_3:fugitive_4|Then drop your sword. If you are innocent, you have nothing to fear. We'll go now and talk to your neighbours, and if they verify your story, I'll go on my way.
dlga_fugitive_4:fugitive_5|I'm not going anywhere, friend. You're going to have to fight for your silver, today.
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start|No problem. I really just need your head, anyway.
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start.1|I come not for money, but to execute the law!
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start.2|Alas, that you cannot be made to see reason.
dlga_fugitive_fight_start:close_window|Die, dog!
dlga_member_chat:sacrificed_messenger_1|Yes {sir/madam}?
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_1:sacrificed_messenger_2|Take this letter to {s1} and give it to {s2}.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_1:close_window|Nothing. Nothing at all.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_2:sacrificed_messenger_3|Yes {sir/madam}. You can trust me. I will not fail you.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_3:close_window|Good. I will not forget your service. You will be rewarded when you return.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_3:sacrificed_messenger_cancel|Arggh! I can't do this. I can't send you to your own death!
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel:sacrificed_messenger_cancel_2|What do you mean {sir/madam}, 
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel_2:sacrificed_messenger_cancel_3|There's a trap set up for you in the town. {s3} ordered me to sacrifice one of my chosen warriors to fool the enemy, but he will just need to find another way.
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel_3:close_window|Thank you, {sir/madam}. I will follow you to the gates of hell. But this would not be a good death.
dlga_start:close_window.96|Don't worry, {sir/madam}, I'm on my way.
dlga_start:follow_spy_talk|Good day {sir/madam}. Such fine weather don't you think? If you'll excuse me now I must go on my way.
dlga_follow_spy_talk:follow_spy_talk_2|In the name of {s1}, you are under arrest!
dlga_follow_spy_talk_2:close_window|You won't get me alive!
dlga_follow_spy_talk:close_window|Never mind me. I was just passing by.
dlga_start:spy_partners_talk|Greetings.
dlga_spy_partners_talk:spy_partners_talk_2|In the name of {s1} You are under arrest!
dlga_spy_partners_talk_2:close_window|You will have to fight us first!
dlga_spy_partners_talk:close_window|Never mind me. I was just passing by.
dlga_start:qzdrada1|Czego chcecie?
dlga_qzdrada1:close_window.1|You are under arrest.
dlga_qzdrada1:close_window.2|Nevermind.
dlga_qzdrada2:qzdrada2p1|I'll take you back to the Chief.
dlga_qzdrada2:qzdrada2p2|Honor? Justice?
dlga_qzdrada2p1:close_window|But of course, I will take you back to the Chief, and he will most likely send you straight to the gallows.
dlga_qzdrada2p2:close_window|Honor? Justice? Yes, I am rather fond of those ideals. For treason, death and infamy is the only sentence I can give out. Execute!
dlga_start:runaway_serf_intro_1|Good day {sir/madam}.
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_1:runaway_serf_intro_2|I have been sent by your {s4} whom you are running from. He will not punish you if you return now.
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_2:runaway_serf_intro_3|My good {sir/madam}. Our lives at our village {s1} was unbearable. We worked all day long and still went to bed hungry. We are going to {s6} to start a new life, where we will be treated like humans.
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_3:runaway_serf_go_back|You have gone against our laws by running from your bondage. You will go back to {s1} now!
dlga_runaway_serf_intro_3:runaway_serf_let_go|Well, maybe you are right. All right then. If anyone asks, I haven't seen you.
dlga_runaway_serf_go_back:close_window|All right {sir/madam}. As you wish. We'll head back to {s5} now.
dlga_runaway_serf_let_go:close_window|God bless you, {sir/madam}. We will not forget your help.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_reconsider|Good day {sir/madam}. Don't worry. If anyone asks, we haven't seen you.
dlga_runaway_serf_reconsider:runaway_serf_go_back|I have changed my mind. You must back to your village!
dlga_runaway_serf_reconsider:runaway_serf_let_go|Good. Go quickly now before I change my mind.
dlga_start:runaway_serf_talk_caught|Good day {sir/madam}. We were heading back to {s5}, but I am afraid we lost our way.

dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Greetings to you, {sir/madam}. You look like someone who should get to know me.
dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|Why is that?
dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|I broker ransoms for the poor wretches who are captured in these endless wars. Normally I travel between the salt mines and the slave markets on the coast, on commission from those whose relatives have gone missing. But if I'm out on my errands of mercy, and I come across a fellow dragging around a captive or two, well, there's no harm in a little speculative investment, is there? And you look like the type who might have a prisoner to sell.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_families|What if their families can't pay?
dlga_ransom_broker_families:ransom_broker_info_talk|Oh, then I spin them a few heartwarming tales of life on the galleys. You'd be surprised what sorts of treasures a peasant can dig out of his cowshed or wheedle out of his cousins, assuming he's got the proper motivation! And if in the end they cannot come up with the silver, then there are always slave merchants who are looking for galley slaves. One cannot do Heaven's work with an empty purse, you see.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|What can I get for a prisoner?
dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|It varies. I fancy that I have a fine eye for assessing a ransom. There are a dozen little things about a man that will tell you whether he goes to bed hungry, or dines each night on soft dumplings and goose. The real money of course is in the gentry, and if you ever want to do my job you'll want to learn about every landowning family in Calradia, their estates, their heraldry, their offspring both lawful and bastard, and, of course, their credit with the merchants, 
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_me|Would you be able to ransom me if I were taken?
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_me:ransom_broker_info_talk|Of course. I'm welcome in every court in Calradia. There's not many who can say that! So always be sure to keep a pot of denars buried somewhere, and a loyal servant who can find it in a hurry.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thank you.
dlga_start:ransom_broker_talk|Greetings. If you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
dlga_ransom_broker_pretalk:ransom_broker_talk|Anyway, if you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners|Then you'd better bring your purse. I have got prisoners to sell.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_intro_2|Tell me about what you do again.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_companion|I wish to ransom one of my companions.
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion:ransom_broker_ransom_companion_choose|Whom do you wish to ransom?

I remember hearing that the rats down there are unusually large -- like mastiffs, they say... Now... For the very reasonable sum of {reg5} denars, which includes both the ransom and my commission and expenses, we can arrange it so that {s5} can once again enjoy {reg4?her:his} freedom. What do you say?
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_verify:ransom_broker_ransom_companion_accept|Here's your money.
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_verify:ransom_broker_ransom_companion_refuse|I can't afford that right now.
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_accept:ransom_broker_talk|Splendid! In a few days, I would think, you should find {s5} riding to rejoin you, blinking in the sunlight and no doubt very grateful! Is there any other way in which I can help you?
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_refuse:ransom_broker_talk|Of course, of course... Never mind what they say about the rats, by the way -- I've never actually seen one myself, on account of the pitch-black darkness. Anyway, I'm sure that {s5} will understand why it's important for you to control expenditures. Now... Was there anything else?
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:close_window|Not this time. Good-bye.
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2|Let me see what you have...
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|I will be staying here for a few days. Let me know if you need my services.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk|Greetings, friend. You look like the kind of {man/person} who'd do well to know me. I travel a lot all across Calradia and keep an open ear. I can provide you information that you might find useful. For a meager price of course.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks|Greetings, {playername}. I saw your companion {s10} at a tavern in {s11} some days ago. I thought you might like to know.
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk|Thanks. I'll go and find {reg3?her:him} there.
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk.1|Thanks, but I don't really care.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk.1|Greetings, {playername}.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretalk:tavern_traveler_talk|Yes?
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|What can you tell me about this land?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|Calradia is divided into rival kingdoms, which can neither manage to live in peace with their neighbours, nor completely eliminate them. As a result, there's seldom a break to the bitter wars which plague this land and drain its life blood. Well, at least this must be a good place to be for an adventurer such as yourself. With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, amass a fortune perhaps, or gain great power. Opportunities are endless and so are the rewards, if you are willing to risk your life for them, 
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|Tell me more about these opportunities.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:close_window|Thank you. That was all I needed to know, 
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already. You seem to be doing pretty well.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a|The kingdoms will pay good money for mercenaries if they are engaged in a war. If you have done a bit of fighting, speaking with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a mercenary contract. However the real rewards come if you can manage to become a vassal to a king. A vassal can own villages, castles and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates. Normally, only nobles of the realm own land in this way, but in time of war, a king will not hesitate to accept someone who distinguishes {himself/herself} on the battlefield as a vassal, and grant {him/her} the right to own land, 
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|It is not unheard-of for adventurers to renounce allegiance to a Calradian king altogether, declare themselves kings, and claim land in their own name. This is a difficult path, however, as the great nobles of the land, with their long ancestries, are not likely to accept such upstarts as their monarch. Such rulers would need to be very careful in establishing their right to rule, or they would be set upon from all sides.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|It might be easier for an adventurer like yourself to pledge support to an existing king's rival.  There are many such pretenders in Calradia -- those who are born to the right family, who go around and stir up trouble saying they have a better claim to the throne than the current king. If those claim holders could find supporters, they could easily start civil wars and perhaps even replace the king one day.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interesting. Where can I find these claim holders?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:close_window|I guess I heard enough already. Thank you.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|A claim holder's life would be in danger in his own country of course. Therefore, they usually stay at rival courts, raising support and hoping to find someone willing to champion their cause. I usually hear news about some of them, and may be able to tell you their location with some precision. But of course, I would ask for a little something for such a service.
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_pretender_location|I want to know the location of a claimant.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretender_location:tavern_traveler_pretender_location_ask|Whose location do you want to know?
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretender_location_ask:tavern_traveler_pretender_location_ask_2|{s11}, 
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretender_location_ask:tavern_traveler_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretender_location_ask_2:tavern_traveler_pretender_location_ask_money|I can reveal this information to you for a small price, let's say 30 denars.

dlga_start:minstrel_1|Greetings to you, {most noble sir/most noble lady}.
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_job_description|What is it you do?
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_questions|I have some questions about courtship in Calradia, 
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_poem|Can you teach me any poems?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach|I can teach you the poem, The Storming of the Castle of Love.' It is short enough to be easily learned. It is an allegoric poem, replete with symbols and metaphor. It describes how a brave but rough warrior wins the heart of his lady by learning the virtues of chivalry, becoming a true and noble knight. Its theme -- that the role of a woman is to inspire but also civilize a man -- is appreciated by some noble ladies, but not all.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.1|I can teach you the poem, The Heart's Desire.' It is a lyrical poem, which can be interpreted either erotically or spiritually. The lover realizes the majesty of the divine by gazing upon the body of his beloved. I believe that it appeals to women of a certain romantic temperament, but you risk scandalizing or boring others.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.2|I can teach you the tale of Kais and Layala. It is a sad and simple story -- the shepherd boy Kais and the nobleman's daughter Layala love each other, but they can never marry. The poem is Kais' lament as he wanders alone, unwilling to forget his true love, driving himself mad with longing. Some ladies melt at the sweetness of his sorrows, others glaze over at his self-pity.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.3|I can teach you part of the saga of Helgerad and Kara. It is a heroic tale, full of blood and battle. The shieldmaiden Kara chooses the warrior Helgered as her lover, as he is the only man who can defeat her in combat. Her father, who pledged her to another, comes with his sons and his huscarls to kill Helgered. They fight, and Helgered and Kara slaughter the entire host except for Kara's beloved younger brother -- who, alas, grows up to avenge his father by slaying Helgered. The depiction of warrior and shieldmaiden as equals will appeal to some women, but a mail-wearing, blood-spattered heroine will shock and repulse others.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.4|I can teach you the poem, An Argument in the Garden.' It is a comic poem, which satirizes the conventions of courtly love. A lover steals into a garden in Veluca, and plies her with lots of witty lines to persuade his lover to submit to his embraces. She shoots down all of his advances one by one, then when he is downcast, she takes him in her arms and tells him that she wanted him all along, except on her terms, not his. A lady with a sense of humor may find it amusing, but others might feel that they are the ones who are being mocked, 
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2|To teach it to you, I will need some hours of your time -- and, of course, a small fee for my services. About 300 denars would suffice.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_pretalk|I believe you already know the poems I am best equipped to teach.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3|Yes -- teach me that one, 
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2:minstrel_pretalk|Never mind, 
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_4|Very well -- repeat after me:^   I deflected her skeptical questioning darts^   with armor made of purest devotion^   purged in the forge of my heart^   from the slag of any baser emotion, 
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_4.1|Very well -- repeat after me:^   You are the first and the last^   the outer and the inner^   When I drink from the cup of love^   I escape the tread of time^   A moment in solitude with you^   Would have no beginning and no end, 
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_4.2|Very well -- repeat after me:^  The wind that blows the dry steppe dust^  Stirs the curtains in your tower^  The moon that lights my drunken path home^  Looks on you sleeping in your bower^  If I cried out to the wind^  Could it carry a message from my lips?^  If I wept before the moon^  Would it grant me just a glimpse?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_4.3|Very well -- repeat after me:^   A light pierced the gloom over Wercheg cliffs...^   Where charge of surf broke on shieldwall of shore^   Grey-helmed and grey-cloaked the maiden stood^   On wave-steed's prow, the sailcloth snapping^   Over din of oars, of timbers cracking^   She cried out to her hearth-brothers, arrayed for war
dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_3:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_4.4|Very well -- repeat after me:^All the silks of Veluca, all the furs of Khudan^Would buy you not the briefest kiss^What I bestow, I bestow for love^And the sake of my own happiness^But brought you a gift? Let us see! Let us see!^Or should tell my father how you came to see me?

dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_role|Is there a place for me in the game of love?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_meet|How would a suitor meet a lady?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo|Having met a lady, how would the suitor woo her?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_nobles|Tell me about marriage and love among the nobility of Calradia, 
dlga_minstrel_nobles:minstrel_nobles_2|Nobles are an odd lot. In Calradia, a daughter is a political asset, to be given away to a lord with whom her father wishes to make an alliance. Yet the great families of this land idealize pure love between man and woman, and I have seen many a hardened warrior weep copious tears at the doomed ardour of Sahira and Janun in the songs -- even as he made plans to break his own daughter's heart.
dlga_minstrel_nobles_2:minstrel_nobles_3|Fathers differ, of course. Some Calradian nobles will let their daughters choose a husband who pleases them. Others, however, feel that to allow their daughters any choice at all would be to diminish their own authority, and insist on imposing a groom whether she likes it or not.
dlga_minstrel_nobles_3:minstrel_prequestions|But the majority will steer a middle course -- they will want to make the final decision about a groom, but will weigh their daughter's preferences heavily. Among other factors, a happy marriage is more likely to produce heirs. So, there is a place for courtship, and for the use of skill and passion to win a lady's heart.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_daughter_father|What if a lady and her father disagree about a suitor?
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father:minstrel_daughter_father_2|It happens sometimes that a bride elopes. This is a major blow to the father's prestige, leading to lasting enmities. Indeed, it is possible that a war may be fought over a woman. Now, that is a fine topic for a song.
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father_2:minstrel_prequestions|In the end, however, most brides will submit to their parents' choice. A noblewoman's family is everything to her, and few are brave enough to risk its disapproval for the sake of man she barely knows. She may pine for her lover, but still accept the groom -- and without tragic love, what would we have to sing about?
dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_player_role_2|Of course! Calradian lords make a great deal of lineage, but in the end, lands and money speak louder than one's ancestors. Even though you are a foreigner, if you are coming up in the world, then many parents will consider you a fine catch.
dlga_minstrel_player_role_2:minstrel_player_role_3|You will have to compete with many other lords of your realm, however, who will have an advantage -- they have known these ladies from childhood, and will have been sized up as grooms by carefully discerning mothers and aunts. Some ladies may be fascinated by the stranger, yet opt for the familiar.
dlga_minstrel_player_role_3:minstrel_prequestions|So know this -- you may have your heart broken. But to enter the arena of love fearing heartbreak is like entering the battlefield fearing the enemy's arrows. Be brave, and shrug off the sting of rejection, and victory may yet be yours.
dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_female_player_3|Lady -- I will speak bluntly. Most of the lords of this land are looking for a demure maiden, whose skin as fair as snow -- and your skin is burnt brown by the sun. They want a maiden whose voice is soft as bells -- and your voice is hoarse from commanding men in battle. Also, athough the lords of Calradia appreciate poems about love, most also want heirs, and few women can ride and fight while with child.
dlga_minstrel_female_player_3:minstrel_prequestions|However, not all lords will be so conventionally minded. We poets sing of shield maidens and of huntresses, of women who forged their own path without having sacrificed the chance for love. I would not tell you that it would be easy for you to find a devoted husband who will accept your ways, but I would not say that it is impossible.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_spouse_benefits|What advantage is there in seeking a {wife/husband}?
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may forge a strong alliance with the bride's family, and a wife may also assist you in manipulating the politics of the realm to your advantage.
dlga_minstrel_wife_benefits_2:minstrel_prequestions|What's more, most of the great families of Calradia have at some point intermarried with royalty, which would boost your own claim to rule -- should you ever choose to assert it...
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2.1|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may have access to the groom's castles and properties, and be able to work with him to advance both of your standings in the realm.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet:minstrel_player_advice_meet_2|Every so often, a king or great lord of Calradia will hold a feast. In towns they will often be accompanied by tournaments, and in castles they will be accompanied by hunts. The feasts provide a chance for the lords to repair some of the rivalries that may undermine the strength of the realm. They also provide an opportunity for families to show off their eligible daughters, and ladies will often be allowed to mingle unsupervised with the guests.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet_2:minstrel_prequestions|If you have the opportunity, you may attempt to pay the lady a compliment. This indicates to her that you are a potential suitor, and she will usually know if she wishes you to continue your suit. Incidentally, if you come to her fresh from having distinguished yourself in the tournament or in the hunt, then you may make a stronger first impression than otherwise.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo:minstrel_player_advice_woo_2|To woo a lady takes a certain amount of time and patience, and several meetings spaced over a period of months. A lady who is interested in you will often find ways of letting you know if she wishes you to come visit her. Alternately, you may simply go and ask her father or brother for permission. If you do not have permission from her guardian, it may be possible to arrange an assignation through other means.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo_3|Having arranged an assignment, you may then attempt to charm her and win her favor. Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of this is finding a topic of conversation. Most Calradian noblewomen lead a cloistered life, at least until they are married, and thus will have little to say that will interest you. On other hand, she will soon tire of hearing of your own deeds in the outside world.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_3:minstrel_player_advice_woo_4|One time-tested mode of courtship is simply to recite a popular poem, and discuss it. This way, you are both on an equal footing, and neither will have an advantage in knowledge or experience. Of course, different ladies will have different tastes in poetry.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_4:minstrel_player_advice_woo_5|At some point, you will be able to discuss directly the issue of marriage. She will then let you know if you measure up to what she wants in a husband. Some ladies will coolly assess who is the most prestigious of her suitors, others will be guided by their passions. Some will look to your companions, to see whether you are the kind of husband who will treat her as an equal, while others will follow the lead of their fathers.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_5:minstrel_prequestions|At any rate, it is a challenging business -- and do not forget, you may find that your suit prospers with a lady, only to have it falter on a father's political ambitions. So you must ask yourself: are you willing to risk disappointment and heartbreak? Alternately, are you willing to throw away your standing in society, to make enemies of allies, in pursuit of a forbidden love? Because if you are, then perhaps some day we will write poems about you.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_job_description|What is it that you poets and musicians do again?
dlga_minstrel_job_description:minstrel_courtship_prequestions|I compose and write songs for the lords of the land, and their ladies. Sometimes I sing about war, sometimes about the virtues of kings, and sometimes, for the more sophisticated audiences, about the virtues of wine. For most audiences, however, I sing of love.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_pretalk|No, that is all.
dlga_minstrel_prequestions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|Do you have any other questions?
dlga_minstrel_pretalk:minstrel_1|Is there anything else?
dlga_start:farmer_from_bandit_village_1|{My lord/Madam}, you look like a {man/lady} of the sword and someone who could help us. Will you hear my plea?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_1:farmer_from_bandit_village_2|What is the matter, my good man?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_1:farmer_from_bandit_village_2.1|What are you burbling about peasant? Speak out.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_2:farmer_from_bandit_village_3|A band of brigands have taken refuge in our village. They take everything we have, force us to serve them, and do us much evil. If one of us so much as breathes a word of protest, they kill the poor soul on the spot right away. Our lives have become unbearable. I risked my skin and ran away to find someone who can help us.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_3:farmer_from_bandit_village_4|Why don't you go to the lord of your village? He should take care of the vermin.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_4:farmer_from_bandit_village_5|I did, {sir/madam}, but our lord's men did not let me see him and said he was occupied with more important matters and that we should deal with our own problem ourselves. Please {sir/madam}, you look like a {man/lady} of valor and a fearsome warrior, and you have no doubt many friends and soldiers at your service. If there is anyone who can help us, it's you.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_5:farmer_from_bandit_village_accepted|Very well, I'll help you. Where is this village?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_5:farmer_from_bandit_village_denied|I can't be bothered with this right now.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_5:farmer_from_bandit_village_barter|Why would I fight these bandits? What's in it for me?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_accepted:close_window|God bless you, {sir/madam}. Our village is {s7}. It is not too far from here.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_denied:close_window|As you say {sir/madam}. Forgive me for bothering you.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_barter:farmer_from_bandit_village_5|We are but poor farmers {sir/madam}, and the bandits have already got most of what we have on this world. but we'll be glad to share with you whatever we have got. And we'll always be in your gratitude if you help us.
dlga_start:close_window.97|Thank you for helping us {sir/madam}. Crush those bandits!
dlga_start:mercenary_tavern_talk|Do you have a need for mercenaries, {sir/madam}? {reg3?Me and {reg4?{reg3} of my mates:one of my mates} are:I am} looking for a master. We'll join you for {reg5} denars.
dlga_start:mercenary_after_recruited|Any orders, {sir/madam}?
dlga_mercenary_after_recruited:mercenary_after_recruited_2|Make your preparations. We'll be moving at dawn.
dlga_mercenary_after_recruited:mercenary_after_recruited_2.1|Take your time. We'll be staying in this town for a while.
dlga_mercenary_after_recruited_2:close_window|Yes {sir/madam}. We'll be ready when you tell us to leave.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:mercenary_tavern_talk_hire|All right. I will hire all of you. Here is {reg5} denars.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:mercenary_tavern_talk_hire.1|All right. But I can only hire {reg6} of you. Here is {reg5} denars.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk_hire:close_window|{s17}, 
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:tavern_mercenary_cant_lead|That sounds good. But I can't afford to hire any more men right now.
dlga_tavern_mercenary_cant_lead:close_window|That's a pity. Well, {reg3?we will:I will} be lingering around here for a while, if you need to hire anyone.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:tavern_mercenary_cant_lead.1|That sounds good. But I can't lead any more men right now.
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:close_window|Sorry. I don't need any other men right now.
dlga_start:trainer_intro_1|Good day to you {lad/lass}. You look like another adventurer who has come to try {his/her} chance in these lands. Well, trust my word, you won't be able to survive long here unless you know how to fight yourself out of a tight spot.
dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Thank you for your advice. This place looks like a training field. Maybe I can learn about fighting here?
dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|Indeed you can. I am a veteran soldier... fought a good deal in the wars in my time. But these days, I train young novices in this area. I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about the theory of combat, feel free to ask.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Yes, I do have a few questions.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4b|Actually, I can move on to practice.
dlga_trainer_intro_4a:trainer_talk_combat|Well, ask anything you like.
dlga_trainer_intro_4b:trainer_practice_1|Good. It's good to find someone eager for practice. Let's see what you will do.
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1|That was a good fight.
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1.1|Ha! Looks like you've developed a bit of a limp there. Don't worry, even losses have their value, provided you learn from them. Shake the stars out of your eyes and get back in there. There's no other way to win.
dlga_start:trainer_talk|Good day. Ready for some training today?
dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Ah, are you ready for some training?
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|I am ready for some practice.
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have a shield?
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.], 
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.], 
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1|I train novices in four stages, each tougher than the one before. To finish a stage and advance to the next one, you have to win three fights in a row.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready|You have passed all stages of training. But if you want you can still practice. Are you ready?
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.1|Way to go {lad/lass}. With this victory, you have advanced to the next training level. From now on your opponents will be regular fighters, not the riff-raff off the street, so be on your toes.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.2|Way to go {lad/lass}. Welcome to the third training level. From now on your opponents will be veteran fighters, soldiers and arena regulars and the like. These guys know some dirty tricks, so keep your defense up.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.3|You've got the heart of a champion, {lad/lass}, and the sword arm to match. From now on your opponents will be champion fighters. These are the cream of the crop, the finest warriors I have trained. If you can best three of them in a row, you will join their ranks.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_finish_training|It does my heart good to see such a promising talent. You have passed all tiers of training. You can now tell everyone that you have been trained by the master of the training field.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training:novicemaster_finish_training_2|Thank you master.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training_2:close_window|I wish you good luck in the tournaments. And, don't forget, if you want to practice your swordwork anytime, just come and say the word.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready.1|Your next opponent will be a {s9}. You need to win {reg8} more fights in a row to advance to the next stage. Are you ready?
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_ready_to_fight|Yes I am.
dlga_novicemaster_ready_to_fight:close_window|Here you go then. Good luck.
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_not_ready|Just a minute. I am not ready yet.
dlga_novicemaster_not_ready:close_window|Hey, You will never make it if you don't practice.
dlga_start:close_window.98|Ruszaj się.
dlga_start_craftsman_soon:close_window|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We hope to begin production in about {reg4} days
dlga_start:master_craftsman_talk|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We are honored that you have chosen to visit us. What do you require?
dlga_master_craftsman_pretalk:master_craftsman_talk|Very good, my {lord/lady}. Do you require anything else?
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_accounts|Let's go over the accounts.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk|Let's check the inventories.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.1|I'd like you to sell goods as they are produced.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.2|I'd like you to keep all goods in the warehouse until I arrive.
dlga_master_craftsman_accounts:master_craftsman_pretalk|We currently produce {s3} worth {reg1} denars each week, while the quantity of {s4} needed to manufacture it costs {reg2}, and labor and upkeep are {reg3}.{s9} This means that we theoretically make a {s12} of {reg0} denars a week, assuming that we have no raw materials in the inventories, and that we sell directly to the market.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_production_options|Could you explain my options related to production?
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options:master_craftsman_production_options_2|Certainly, my {lord/lady}. Most of the time, the most profitable thing for you to do would be to let us buy raw materials and sell the finished goods directly to the market. Because of our longstanding relations with the local merchants, we can usually get a very good price.
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options_2:master_craftsman_pretalk|However, if you find that you can acquire raw materials cheaper outside {s5}, you may place them in the inventories, and we will use them instead of buying from the market. Likewise, if you feel that you can get a better price for the finished goods elsewhere, then you may ask us to deposit what we produce in our warehouses for you to take.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_auction_price|It will no longer be possible for me to continue operating this enterprise.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_price:master_craftsman_auction_decide|A pity, my {lord/lady}. If we sell the land and the equipment, and liquidate the inventories, I estimate that we can get {reg4} denars.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_liquidation|That sounds reasonable. Please proceed with the sale.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_pretalk|Hmm. Let's hold off on that.
dlga_master_craftsman_liquidation:close_window|As you wish. It was an honor to have been in your employ.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:close_window.1|That is all for now.
dlga_start:burmistrz_start|Good day, my lord.
dlga_start:mayor_begin|Good day, my lord.
dlga_start:mayor_talk|Hello stranger, you seem to be new to {s9}. I am the guild master of the town.
dlga_start:mayor_begin.1|Good day, {playername}.
dlga_mayor_begin:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed|{playername}, it was an incredible feat to get {s14} and {s15} make peace, and you made it happen. Your involvement has not only saved our town from disaster, but it has also saved thousands of lives, and put an end to all the grief this bitter war has caused. As the townspeople of {s19}, know that we'll be good on our word, and we are ready to pay the {reg12} denars we promised, 
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay|Thank you. Let me have the money.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay|No need for a payment. I only did what was right.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay:close_window|Oh, yes, of course. We had already got the money for you. Here, please accept these {reg12} denars together with our most sincere thanks. Me and the people of our town will not forget your help.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay:close_window|You are indeed an extraordenary person, {sir/madame}, and it is an honour for me to have known you. You not only did what was impiossible and put an end to this terrible war, but you won't even accept a reward for it. Very well, I will not insist on the matter, but please know that you will have our eternal respect and gratitude.
dlga_mayor_begin:lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed|Very nice work, {playername}, you made short work of those lawless curs. Thank you kindly for all your help, and please accept this bounty of 150 denars.
dlga_lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed:close_window|It was my pleasure, {s65}.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_looters_quest_response|Ah, {playername}. Have you any progress to report?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed|I've killed some looters.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods|I've brought you some goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:close_window|Not yet, sir. Farewell.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2|Aye, my scouts saw the whole thing. That should make anyone else think twice before turning outlaw! The bounty is 40 denars for every band, so that makes {reg1} in total. Here is your money, as promised.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:close_window|And that's not the only good news! Thanks to you, the looters have ceased to be a threat. We've not had a single attack reported for some time now.   If there are any of them left, they've either run off or gone deep into hiding. That's good for business, and what's good for business is good for the town!   I think that concludes our arrangement, {playername}. Please accept this silver as a token of my gratitude. Thank you, and farewell.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Hah, I knew I could count on you! Just tell me which item to take from your baggage, and I'll send some men to collect it. I still need {reg1} denars' worth of goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_2|{s5}.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_3|Nothing at the moment, sir.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_3:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Excellent, here is the money for your {s6}. Do you have any more goods to give me? I still need {reg1} denars' worth of goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:close_window|Well done, {playername}, that's the last of the goods I need. Here is the money for your {s6}, and a small bonus for helping me out. I'm afraid I won't be paying for any more goods, nor bounties on looters, but you're welcome to keep hunting the bastards if any remain. Thank you for your help, I won't forget it, 
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window|Good to see you again {playername}. I have heard that you have delivered the cattle successfully. I will tell the merchants how reliable you are. And here is your pay, {reg8} denars.
dlga_mayor_begin:move_cattle_herd_failed|I heard that you have lost the cattle herd on your way to {s9}. I had a very difficult time explaining your failure to the owner of that herd, {sir/madam}. Do you have anything to say?
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2|I am sorry. But I was attacked on the way.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2.1|I am sorry. The stupid animals wandered off during the night.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed_2:merchant_ask_for_debts|Well, it was your responsibility to deliver that herd safely, no matter what. You should know that the owner of the herd demanded to be compensated for his loss, and I had to pay him 1000 denars. So you now owe me that money.
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.1|{playername} -- I am in your debt for bringing back my friend's daughter.  Please take these {reg8} denars that I promised you.  My friend wished he could give more but paying that ransom brought him to his knees.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk|Well -- it sounds like you were able to track down the bandits, and show them what happens to those who would disrupt the flow of commerce. Here is your reward: {reg5} denars. It is well earned, and we are most grateful.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.1|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those bandits the punishment they deserved. You are really as good as they say. Here is your reward: {reg5} denars. I would like to give more but those bandits almost brought me to bankruptcy.
dlga_mayor_begin:merchant_ask_for_debts|According to my accounts, you owe the merchants guild {reg1} denars. I'd better collect that now.
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_paid|Alright. I'll pay my debt to you.
dlga_merchant_debts_paid:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I'll let my fellow merchants know that you are clear of any debts.
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_not_paid|I'm afraid I can't pay that sum now.
dlga_merchant_debts_not_paid:close_window|In that case, I am afraid, I can't deal with you. Guild rules... Come back when you can pay the {reg1} denars. And know that we'll be charging an interest to your debt. So the sooner you pay it, the better.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_talk|What can I do for you?
dlga_mayor_friendly_pretalk:mayor_talk|Now... What else may I do for you?
dlga_mayor_pretalk:mayor_talk|Yes?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_info_begin|Can you tell me about what you do?
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_requested|Do you happen to have a job for me?
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_last_offered_job|About that job you offered me...
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_about_job|About the job you gave me...
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_political_talk|I have some questions of a political nature.
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_economy_report_1|How is trade around here?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_wealth_comparison_1|How does the wealth of this region compare with the rest of Calradia?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_investment_possible|I wish to buy land in this town for a productive enterprise, 
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk|You already operate a {s4} here. There probably aren't enough skilled tradesmen to start a second enterprise.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.1|{s9}, 
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.1|Of course, {sir/my lady}. You are the lord of this town, and no one is going to stop you.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment|Well... Given your relationship with our liege, {s4}, I think that you will not find many here who are brave enough to sell you any land.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.2|Well... To be honest, I think that we in the guild would like to know you a little better. We can be very particular about outsiders coming in here and buying land.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.2|Very good, {sir/my lady}. We in the guild know and trust you, and I think I could find someone to sell you the land you need.
dlga_mayor_investment_advice:investment_choose_enterprise|A couple of things to keep in mind -- skilled laborers are always at a premium, so I doubt that you will be able to open up more than one enterprise here. In order to make a profit for yourself, you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply, but for which the raw materials are cheap. What sort of enterprise would you like to start?
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary|A mill and bakery, to make bread from grain
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.1|A brewery, to make ale from grain
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.2|A tannery, to make leather from hides
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.3|A wine press, to make wine from grapes
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.4|An oil press, to make oil from olives
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.5|An ironworks, to make tools from iron
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.6|A weavery and dyeworks, to make velvet from silk and dye
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.7|A weavery, to make wool cloth from wool
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.8|A weavery, to make linen from flax
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:mayor_pretalk|Never mind, 
dlga_investment_summary:mayor_investment_confirm|Very good, sir. The land and the materials on which you may build your {s3} will cost you {reg7} denars. Right now, your {s3} will produce {s4} worth {reg1} denars each week, while the {s6} needed to manufacture that batch will be {reg2} and labor and upkeep will be {reg3}.{s9} I should guess that your profit would be {reg0} denars a week. This assumes of course that prices remain constant -- which, I can virtually guarantee you, they will not. Do you wish to proceed?
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_investment_purchase|Yes. Here is money for the land.
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_pretalk|No -- that's not economical for me at the moment.
dlga_mayor_investment_purchase:mayor_pretalk|Very good. Your enterprise should be up and running in about a week. When next you come, and thereafter, you should speak to your {s4} about its operations.
dlga_mayor_talk:close_window|[Leave], 
dlga_mayor_info_begin:mayor_info_talk|I am the guildmaster of {s9}. You can say I am the leader of the good people of {s9}. I can help you find a job if you are looking for some honest work.
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_info_lord|Who rules this town?
dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|Our town's lord and protector is {s10}. He owns the castle and sometimes resides there, and collects taxes from the town. However we regulate ourselves in most of the matters that concern ourselves. As the town's guildmaster I have the authority to decide those things.
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thanks.
dlga_mayor_political_talk:mayor_political_questions|Politics? Good heaven, the guild has nothing to do with politics. We are loyal servants of {s10}. We merely govern our own affairs, and pass on the townspeople's concerns to our lords and masters, and maybe warn them from time to time against evil advice. Anyway, what did you wish to ask?
dlga_mayor_prepolitics:mayor_political_questions|Did I mention that we here are all {s9}? Because I can't stress that enough... Anyway... Is there anything else?
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_war_description_1|What is the cause of all these wars in Calradia?
dlga_mayor_war_description_1:mayor_war_description_2|Well, to answer your question generally, each monarch claims to be the rightful heir to the old Calradic emperors. Some of these claims are based on forgotten dynastic marriages and others are based on obscure promises, while {s22} Rhodoks invoke the empire's unwritten constitution. So in theory, any one realm has the right to declare war on any other realm at any time.
dlga_mayor_war_description_2:mayor_war_description_3|In practice, to make war is exhausting work. It is easy enough to lay waste to the enemy's farmland, but crops will grow back, and it is a far different matter to capture an enemy stronghold and to hold it. So the monarchs of Calradia will fight a little, sign a truce, fight a little more, and so on and so forth. Often, a monarch will go to war when another realm provokes them. At such times, some bad influences who look to enrich themselves with ransoms and pillage will clamor for retribution, and thus the damage caused by war to a monarch's treasury is less than the damage caused by doing nothing would be to his authority... I'm of course not talking about {s10}, as no one would ever question {reg4?her:his} authority, 
dlga_mayor_war_description_3:mayor_war_description_4|I would stress again that we in the guild have nothing to do with politics. But if {s10} were to ask for my advice on these matters, as a loyal subject, I would tell {reg4?her:him} that while {reg4?her:his} claim to all of Calradia is truly just, even the most legitimate claim must be backed by armed men, and armed men want money, and money comes from trade, and war ruins trade, so sometimes the best way to push a claim is not to push it, if you know what I mean..
dlga_mayor_war_description_4:mayor_prepolitics|You may tell {s10} this if you see {reg4?her:him}. Don't mention my name specifically -- just say 'the people of {s4}' told you this. Our personal opinion, of course, as to what would be in {s10}'s best interests. None of us would ever dream of questioning a monarch's sovereign right to push {reg4?her:his} legitimate claims.
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_politics_assess|What is {s10}'s policy in regards to the other realms of Calradia?
dlga_mayor_politics_assess:mayor_politics_assess_realm|Which realm did you have in mind?
dlga_mayor_politics_assess_realm:mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment|{s11}, 
dlga_mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment:mayor_prepolitics|{s14}, 
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_internal_politics|What can you say about the internal politics of the realms?
dlga_mayor_internal_politics:mayor_internal_politics_2|Well, here in the {s4} we are all united by our love for {s5} and support for {reg4?her:his} legitimate claim to the rulership of all Calradia. But I have heard some talk of internal bickering in other realms...
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_2:mayor_internal_politics_3|The lords of a realm often have very different ideas about honor, strategy, and the way a nobleman should behave. In addition, they compete with each other for the ruler's favor, and are constantly weighing up their position -- how they stand, how their friends and family stand, and how their enemies stand, 
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_3:mayor_internal_politics_4|Underlying all the tensions is the possibility that a lord may abandon his liege, and pledge vassalhood to another. In theory, each lord has sworn an oath of vassalage, but in practice, a vassal can always find an excuse to absolve himself. The vassal may claim that the liege has failed to hold up his end of the bargain, to protect the vassal and treat him justly. Or, the vassal may claim that his liege is in fact a usurper, and another has a better claim to the kingship.
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_4:mayor_internal_politics_5|Lieges and vassals still watch each other carefully. If a king believes that his vassal is going to change sides or rebel, he may indict the vassal for treason and seize his properties. Likewise, if a vassal fears that he will be indicted, he may rebel. Usually, whoever makes the first move will be able to control the vassal's fortresses.
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_5:mayor_prepolitics|Now, men do not trust a vassal who turns coat easily, nor do they trust a king who lightly throws around charges of treason. Those two factors can keep a realm together. But if relations between a vassal and a liege deteriorate far enough, things can become very tense indeed... In other lands, of course. These things could never happen here in the {s4}.
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_pretalk|That is all. Thank you.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job:merchant_quest_about_job_2|What about it?
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_what_if_fail|What if I can't finish it?
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_about_job_working|Well, I'm still working on it.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_working:mayor_pretalk|Good. I'm sure you will handle it.
dlga_merchant_quest_last_offered_job:merchant_quest_brief|Eh, you want to reconsider that. Good...
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk|I hope you don't fail. In that case, I'll have to ask for the price of the cargo you were carrying.
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk.1|Well, just do your best to finish it.
dlga_merchant_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I am counting on you then. Good luck.
dlga_merchant_quest_stall:mayor_pretalk|Well, the job will be available for a few more days I guess. Tell me if you decide to take it.
dlga_mayor_economy_report_1:mayor_economy_report_2|{s32}, 
dlga_mayor_economy_report_2:mayor_economy_report_3|{s42}, 
dlga_mayor_economy_report_3:mayor_pretalk|{s47}, 
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief|Well, you look able enough. I think I might have something you could do.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|We've had some fighting near the {s5} lately, with all the chaos that comes with it, and that's led some of our less upstanding locals to try and make their fortune out of looting the shops and farms during the confusion. A lot of valuable goods were taken. I need somebody to teach those bastards a lesson. Sound like your kind of work?
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_looters_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_brief:close_window|Excellent! You'll find the looters roaming around the countryside, probably trying to rob more good people. Kill or capture the bastards, I don't care what you do with them. I'll pay you a bounty of 40 denars on every band of looters you destroy, until all the looters are dealt with.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_explain_2|Well, there is a very great favor which you could do us... As you may have heard, some {s10}s have come across the border to attack our people. {s5} is under great pressure from some of the more bellicose of his vassals to respond with a declaration of war. Unfortunately, while the great lords of this land grow rich from bloodshed, we of the commons will be caught in the middle, and will suffer.
dlga_merchant_quest_explain_2:merchant_quest_brief|We are not saying that {s5} should overlook this aggression -- far from it! But if he charges one of his own lords to respond, then the cycle of provocation will necessarily lead to a full-fledged confrontation. Now, if an outsider were to step in and defeat a {s10} lord in battle, then honor would be done, and it would defuse the clamor for war. If the defeated lord were a known troublemaker -- {s7} -- then the {s10}s might be able to overlook it.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm|We need you to attack and defeat {s7}. This will not be an easy task, and that outsider would damage {his/her} relationship with the {s10}s, but we would be very grateful. We could not acknowledge a connection with that outsider, but we could be sure that {he/she} would be handsomely rewarded... Could you do this?
dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I can do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_pretalk|I would prefer not to get mixed up in such things, 
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice|The raiders are likely to have laid up their ships in a well-concealed cove, somewhere along the coastline, preferably next to a small stream where they have some water. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of sea raiders who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.1|Bandits such as these usually establish their hideouts in the foothills on the edge of the desert, often in a canyon near a spring. This gives them both water and concealment. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of desert bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.2|Bandits such as these will usually establish a base in the highlands, often on an steep ledge where they have a view of the surrounding countryside. This makes them difficult to surprise. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of mountain bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.3|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments deep in the woods, sometimes in the middle of a swamp. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of forest bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.4|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments in the woodland on the steppe, where they have some concealment. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of steppe bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_destroy_lair_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice.5|Bandits such as these will usually set up their encampments deep in the woods. The best way to discover its location would be to find a group of tundra bandits who appear to be heading back to their base to resupply, and follow them.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice:merchant_quest_destroy_lair_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandit_lair_choice:lord_pretalk|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
dlga_merchant_quest_destroy_lair_brief:close_window|Very good. We will await word of your success.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.1|We have heard that {s4}, some travellers on the road {reg4?to:from} {s5} were attacked by {s7}.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice|We would like you to track these {s4} down. The merchants of the town were able to get a description of their leader, and have put together a bounty. If you can hunt them down and destroy them, we'll make it worth your while...
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief:close_window|Very good. The band may not have lingered long in the area, but chances are that they will be spotted by other travellers on the road.
dlga_merchant_quest_track_bandits_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.2|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to deliver some {s4}. Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine|I have a cargo of {s6} that needs to be delivered to the tavern in {s4}. If you can take {reg5} units of {s6} to {s4} in 7 days, you may earn {reg8} denars. What do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will make the delivery.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I can't carry all that cargo now.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.3|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to escort a caravan. Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief|I am going to send a caravan of goods to {s8}. However with all those bandits and deserters on the roads, I don't want to send them out without an escort. If you can lead that caravan to {s8} in 15 days, you will earn {reg8} denars. Of course your party needs to be at least {reg4} strong to offer them any protection.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will escort the caravan.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I don't have that many soldiers with me.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall.1|Sorry. I can't do that right now, 
dlga_start:close_window.99|We can cover the rest of the way ourselves. Thanks.
dlga_start:close_window.100|Well, we have almost reached {s21}. We can cover the rest of the way ourselves. Here's your pay... {reg14} denars. Thanks for escorting us. Good luck.
dlga_start:merchant_caravan_intro_1|Greetings. You must be our escort, right?
dlga_merchant_caravan_intro_1:merchant_caravan_intro_2|Yes. My name is {playername}. I will lead you to {s1}.
dlga_merchant_caravan_intro_2:escort_merchant_caravan_talk|Well, It is good to know we won't travel alone. What do you want us to do now?
dlga_start:escort_merchant_caravan_talk|Eh. We've made it this far... What do you want us to do?
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_talk:merchant_caravan_follow_lead|You follow my lead. I'll take you through a safe route.
dlga_merchant_caravan_follow_lead:close_window|Alright. We'll be right behind you.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_talk:merchant_caravan_stay_here|You stay here for a while. I'll go ahead and check the road.
dlga_merchant_caravan_stay_here:close_window|Alright. We'll be waiting here for you.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.4|Actually, I was looking for an able adventurer like you. There's this group of particularly troublesome bandits. They have infested the vicinity of our town and are preying on my caravans. They have avoided all the soldiers and the militias up to now. If someone doesn't stop them soon, I am going to be ruined...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:troublesome_bandits_quest_brief|I will pay you {reg8} denars if you hunt down those troublesome bandits. It's dangerous work. But I believe that you are the {man/one} for it. What do you say?
dlga_troublesome_bandits_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken_bandits|Very well. I will hunt down those bandits.
dlga_merchant_quest_taken_bandits:close_window|You will? Splendid. Good luck to you.
dlga_troublesome_bandits_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|Sorry. I don't have time for this right now.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.5|Actually, I was looking for a reliable {man/helper} that can undertake an important mission. A group of bandits have kidnapped the daughter of a friend of mine and are holding her for ransom. My friend is ready to pay them, but we still need someone to take the money to those rascals and bring the girl back to safety.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:kidnapped_girl_quest_brief|The amount the bandits ask as ransom is {reg12} denars. I will give you that money once you accept to take the quest. You have 15 days to take the money to the bandits who will be waiting near the village of {s4}. Those bastards said that they are going to kill the poor girl if they don't get the money by that time. You will get your pay of {reg8} denars when you bring the girl safely back here.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_brief:kidnapped_girl_quest_taken|All right. I will take the ransom money to the bandits and bring back the girl.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_taken:close_window|Good. I knew we could trust you at this. Here is the ransom money, {reg12} denars. Count it before taking it. And please, don't attempt to do anything rash. Keep in mind that the girl's well being is more important than anything else...
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|Sorry. I don't have time for this right now.

dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject:close_window|Hah. The nobles fight their wars for their greed and their dreams of glory. And it is poor honest folk like us who have to bear the real burden. But you obviously don't want to hear about that.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3|There have been attempts to reconcile the two sides and reach a settlement. However, there are powerful lords on both sides whose interests lie in continuing the war. These men urge all others not to heed to the word of sensible men, but to keep fighting. While these leaders remain influential, no peace settlement can be reached.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4|Who are these warmongers who block the way of peace?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4.1|Who are these lords you speak of?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5|They are {s12} from {s15} and {s13} from {s14}. Until they change their mind or lose their influence, there will be no chance of having peace between the two sides.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6|What can be done about this?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6.1|Alas, it seems nothing can be done about it.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7|There is a way to resolve the issue. A particularly determined person can perhaps persuade one or both of these lords to accept making peace. And even if that fails, it can be possible to see that these lords are defeated by force and taken prisoner. If they are captive, they will lose their influence and they can no longer oppose a settlement... What do you think? Can you do it?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8|It seems difficult. But I will try.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8.1|If the price is right, I may.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8.2|Forget it. This is not my problem.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9|Most of the merchants in the town will gladly open up their purses to support such a plan. I think we can collect {reg12} denars between ourselves. We will be happy to reward you with that sum, if you can work this out. Convince {s12} and {s13} to accept a peace settlement, and if either of them proves too stubborn, make sure he falls captive and can not be ransomed until a peace deal is settled.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10|All right. I will do my best.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_no|Sorry. I can not do this.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10:close_window|Excellent. You will have our blessings. I hope you can deal with those two old goats. We will be waiting and hoping for the good news.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_no:close_window|Don't say no right away. Think about this for some time. If there is a {man/lady} who can manage to do this, it is you.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_deal_with_night_bandits|Do I indeed! There's a group of bandits infesting the town, and I'm at the end of my rope as to how to deal with them.

They only attack lone people, never daring to show themselves when there's a group about. I need someone who can take on these bandits alone and win. That seems to be the only way of bringing them to justice. Are you up to the task?

dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2|Hmmm. How much grain do you need?
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject|I can't be bothered with this. Ask help from someone else.

I'll tell you what -- if all goes well, I'll meet you in the tavern again shortly, and let you know how it all came out. If you don't see me in the tavern, but instead see my head on a spike over the city gate, I'll assume you know enough to stay out of town for a while and forget this whole episode ever happened. So -- hopefully we'll meet again!
dlga_start:merchant_quest_1_prologue_1|{s1}, 
dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_1:merchant_quest_1_prologue_2|We've always had brigands in the hills, driven to banditry by war, debt, or love of violence. Recently, however, they've been getting bolder -- leaving their camps in the wild and venturing into town, looking for unwary prey. The watch commander tells us it's because of all the fighting on the frontiers -- fewer men to keep an eye on the streets -- but I'm not sure what to make of that. It seems to me that the most logical explanation is that these bandits have an ally inside the walls, who helps them enter unnoticed and helps them identify particularly tempting targets... Last week, you see, they took my brother.
dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_2:merchant_quest_1_prologue_3|I don't know what my brother was thinking -- a lad from a prominent house, out alone after dark in times like these... Well, I suppose you were too, but you're a stranger here, and didn't know how bad things have become. He had no such excuse. But he's family, so what can you do? If you don't protect your kin, then people will start thinking that you can't protect your investements, either, and I can't have that... No doubt the gang will soon send word about a ransom, but I don't care to pay it.
dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_3:merchant_quest_1a|So here's my proposition. You look like you've had a bit of experience with a blade -- and more importantly, you must have a bit of fire in your belly, or you wouldn't be coming to Calradia to seek your fortune. So here's what I'm asking you to do: gather a small party, track down these bandits to their lair, teach them a lesson they won't forget, and get my brother back safe. In return, you'll earn my lasting gratitude and a bit of silver. What do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_1a:merchant_quest_1b|I am interested.
dlga_merchant_quest_1a:close_window|I am not interested, have more important business to do.
dlga_merchant_quest_1b:merchant_quest_1c|You won't be able to do this by yourself, though. If you try and take on the whole gang singlehandedly, the hunter will become the hunted, I'll warrant. You'll first want to round up a group of volunteers. There's always a few lads in the villages around here, looking for a bit of work that's more interesting than tilling the soil or hauling water. They'll follow you if you pay. So... Take this purse of 100 denars. Consider it an advance on your reward. Go round to the villages, and use the money to hire some help. I'll reckon that you need at least five men to take on these bandits.
dlga_merchant_quest_1c:merchant_quest_1d|Very good, sir. I'll go collect some men from around the villages.
dlga_merchant_quest_1d:close_window|Good. You can find me again in the tavern here in {s1} after you've got your group together. Then we'll speak about what we do next.
